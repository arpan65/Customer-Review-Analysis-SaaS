So then I tried to go after the bars, as I had heard Voodoo is 24 hours. It was closed. The universe did not want me to have these legendary doughnuts.

As I was leaving town I finally got one, but the selection was so overwhelming that I freaked out and just picked the first one that spun past me on that little rotating doughnut display, a Tang doughnut. It was unique, a little dry, nothing particularly special, but I'm glad I got to experience it, and wish I could go back to give it another try.

Voodoo's doughnuts are simply amazing. Their voodoo doll, stuffed with jelly ""blood"", is a must-have. My favorite is the Ol' Dirty Bastard, a cake doughnut covered in chocolate sauce and topped with crushed Oreos and peanut butter. Mmm, delicious.

There are a couple caveats. Stay away from the maple bacon bar. The maple bar itself is good, but the bacon is dry, chewy, and just tastes awful. Everyone seems to like it, but I don't understand why. Maybe the folks at Voodoo accidentally put Beggin' Strips on my doughnut or something? Also, skip the ones with fruity powder like grape or bubble gum or the Arnold Palmer, they just leave a weird taste in your mouth.

A group of us got there early on a Friday morning and didn't need to wait in line at all which is apparently unheard of! We got a box of a few different flavors so we could all try them. The assortment included the Captain Crunch, Chocolate Coco Puff donut, Maple Bacon, and a classic old fashion. While the donuts looked pretty and colorful, I didn't particularly think the flavor was all that amazing. They were SUPER sugary and sweet and it was hard to compare to Blue Star Donut which had fresher tasting ingredients.

They make donuts a over the top event that is part entertainment, part excess & the comes with the allure of eating something we know we should not be! Captain Crunch on a overly sweet iced deep fried dough is excessive and also pretty freaking good. 

Also from my recollection they were putting Bacon on stuff before it was cool. And yes the Bacon Maple bar is my favorite if you are asking!

On top of that their customer service sucks. The guy we ordered from was too busy singing along with the music to worry about guest service. Also instead of bagging or boxing our doughnuts, brought each one and tossed them on the counter or on top of each other. 

In terms of the doughnuts we ordered 1 bacon. maple bar, 1 old dirty bastard, 1 voodoo man and 1 mango tango. They're nothing special as far as doughnuts go. They taste like regular doughnuts ... maybe a bit sweeter. The voodoo man is only filled half way with the raspberry filling which left a bunch of dough left over. The mango tango was a weird combination of tart and sweet filling. The only thing that's special about their doughnuts is they're shaped nice.

Don't let the line steer you away from the doughnutty fun. It's a long line, but it keeps moving, so unless you go to Voodoo on a really bad day, you will only have to wait half an hour to an hour or so. 

People-watching helps pass the time spent waiting in line. For instance, a man wearing a kilt and a darth vader mask rode around on his unicycle and played the Star Wars theme on his bagpipes for the folks waiting in line. Definitely entertaining. 

The shop itself is pretty small. Some of the employees are a little testy since they have to deal with tourists day in, day out, so don't get snappy with them.

So admire the glorious revolving doughnut displays instead as well as the quirky merchandise hanging from the walls. That giant doughnut? Go ahead, embrace your inner tourist and take a photo with it. But remember -- figure out what you want to order first because there is a lot to choose from and only so much time before you get to the counter.

We were pretty tame when it came to ordering. We decided to get the Voodoo Doll, the Dirty Snowball, the Bacon Maple Bar and the Grape Ape. It was raining by the time we got out, so we ran over to the nearest cafe to sample the sweets.

These doughnuts are not meant to be the most delicious doughnuts, but they certainly are one-of-a-kind (and still pretty tasty). The Voodoo Doll, for example, is filled with deliciously sinful raspberry jelly. The Bacon Maple Bar was not as fresh as it could have been, but the combination of crispy bacon atop sweet maple frosting was just too good.

My only regret, however, was that I did not do enough research on Voodoo doughnuts.

Plus milks all around. And no we did not eat all of that in one sitting.

Love: 
* The doughnuts, all of mine were genuinely great doughnuts. I don't even like raised doughnuts. 
*The staff, we had a genuinely friendly person help us, asked if we'd been there before, steered us in the right direction, helped us very quickly, but without rushing us.

Not so love:
* There is ALWAYS a line.
* You have to stand outside in the line.
* We felt lucky we had only a 40 minute wait.

We went in the middle of the day and lucky for us the line wasn't too long. Still we waited nearly 30 minutes until we were able to get out of the rain and order inside. Once inside, it was surprisingly small. A counter with 3 cash registers and 2 spiraling display cases full of all unique creations was basically all there was. There was plenty to look at on the walls. I felt like I was in a doughnut themed Amoeba record store. 

The cashiers are very friendly and surprisingly quite patient considering the line of anxious customers that is likely non-stop throughout their shifts. Prices of the doughnuts are not cheap considering they are doughnuts. The actual taste of the doughnuts was quite tasty and very fresh (almost too fresh because some of the chocolate frosting smeared on most of the other doughnuts) although the uniqueness of the doughnuts are merely cosmetic. Still you'll get a good chuckle out of some of their creations.

All things considered, as a tourist Voodoo Doughnuts was worth the visit. The price and the wait are some of the biggest deterrents to this Portland attraction.

Police officer just stopped talking to some barely legal chick and sped off. Transients headed in the other direction after grumbling at each other.

Finally get inside, order the Voodoo Dozen and a couple of extra Voodoo Dolls for the ghouls, excuse me children, to impale repeatedly with the lil pretzel stick that sticks out of the doughnut. That was a bit creepy to see.

Our Dozen was okay. Some flavors were stellar, still others made it straight to the trash can with barely a bite taken from them.

Triple Chocolate Penetration, much bally-ho'd was nasty! Cocoa Crisp cereal on top was stale and chocolate glaze tasted off. Trash can.

Tangfastic, tangy and eaten post-haste.

Captain My Captain, in theory this should have been a home run. Instead it was merely a blooper hit to shallow right. We took bites this one ended up en la basura.

Voodoo Dolls, were fan-freakin' tastic! My 8 yo son actually said that and then shoved half of the doughnut in his mouth.  His ghoulish twin sister thought it was a hoot to pretend her doughnut was her brother and stab it repeatedly. Yes, therapy will be needed for both children.

Butterfingering, husband ate this one whole before I could even really get a good look at it. 'Nough said.

I knew I wanted to try a creme filled doughnut, so I asked for a recommendation.

I don't normally eat doughnuts, but it turned out to be amazing. Incredibly sweet and delicious. My co-worker ordered the buttermilk bar doughnut, so I tried a piece and it was also very enjoyable.

We ordered a dozen assorted doughnuts for our co-workers, and I was also able to try the double chocolate, which is simply a chocolate cake doughnut with chocolate frosting.

We made the two hour drive down from Olympia in the pouring rain. We arrived pretty early on Saturday and found that the line was already wrapped around the outside of the building. Obviously, in this part of the country you can't let standing in the rain for 30 minutes stop you. 

We used our line time to scan the menu online and choose our flavors. The longer we waited the larger our wish list grew. We settled on a dozen donuts for the two of us.

The Maple Bar was the best donut of the bunch. The Grape Ape and Mango Tango were good too. I liked the sugar crunch and the flavor of the powders with the icing and donut. Everything with cereal on top was a disappointment since all of the cereal tasted stale. Cereal on top of the donut sounds interesting, but just doesn't work.

Keep in mind that they only accept cash so make sure to hit the ATM before visiting. I want to say that there was an ATM on site, but I wouldn't count on that. At the time I visited there was also only one table inside because most of the space is used for the line. Plan to have somewhere else to enjoy your donuts.

She said it was just something we had to try while we were on vacation. Overall, I'm glad we went.

The best thing about this place is the fact that it is open 24/7. A lot of complaints I read are about the massive lines and long waits, which is to be expected honestly since Voodoo donuts seems more like a novelty place for locals and a tourist trap. Being those things aren't bad, but of course you should expect a long line and wait. There are ways to get around that though, we decided to go at night around 9-10pm. When we arrived there were only 4 people ahead of us, but by the time we were leaving the line had somehow managed to extend out of the door.

The ambiance of Voodoo donuts is amazing, it's a cute little donut shop and has very attractive decorations. It's a clean place, with many treats to choose from. We got a bunch. My favourites were the Peach fritter with cream cheese frosting on top, the tang covered donut, the butterfinger covered one, and the Marshall Mathers. All of the donuts there are extremely sweet and choc-filled with candy toppings, frostings, and just a ton of sugar. So be aware. The staff are really helpful and always willing to recommend some favourites it seems. The price also isn't too bad.

The only thing I didn't like about Voodoo donuts and why it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that they are cash only. It's 2015, a lot of people like myself just don't always have cash on them. Though for those without cash, they have an atm inside of the donut shop where you can get cash. Unfortunately I'd rather not pay fees just to withdraw money. If they ever accept debit or credit, 5 stars.

When I finally made my way to Portland for a visit recently, I knew I had to stop by. Lucky for me, my hotel was right across the street. The line was long almost every time we went by. On Saturday night we decided the line was probably about as short as it was gonna get and we waited. Even though it seemed long, it moved pretty fast so don't be discouraged! When we finally got inside, it was a bit bigger than I thought it was going to be. They had 3 registers, which is why the line moved fairly fast, and display cases with rotating doughnuts so you can see clearly what you want to order. I ended up getting myself 4 doughnuts: Maple Bacon, ODB, Voodoo Doll, and Sprinkles. They all lived up to my expectations! I ate the ODB that night while fresh, and it was amazing. That was probably my favorite, however it was ridiculously sweet and would probably make me sick if I ate it too often haha. The other 3 made the trip back home with me and I have to say they held up super well. Even after a day or two the donuts still tasted really good. Maple Bacon was a lot better than I thought it might be; it really is a good flavor combo. The Voodoo Doll was  yummy and I liked the raspberry jelly but it also was really sweet. The Sprinkles, which I got so I could try one of their more traditional donuts, was just as delicious and wonderful as the crazy concoctions they're famous for.

I ended up picking two, I opted for a classic glazed donut and a Cap'n Crunch donut... Really Really Good Stuff. I'm no donut expert, but it was by far the best glazed donut i've ever had. It was soft, sweet... almost a donut/cake like texture.  My attempt at a description will do the donut a disservice. It was just GOOD, go get your hands sticky and grab one if you really want to know. The Cap'n Crunch donut was reflective of the glazed but with Cap'n crunch and Crunch Berries stuck to the top. Again, also really really good stuff... Straight sugar overload. 

The place is partly tourist attraction and local hotspot. You can't miss the paisley pink building with the long line of customers outside. You'll see tourist in the parking lot taking selfies with the building in the background and locals walking out with pink boxes of their favorite donuts.

But really? I didn't know someone could possible make donuts worse than Dunkin Donuts. And how do you even mess up a jelly donut exactly? 

Came here around 11pm on a Saturday night just so I can be a tourist and take a picture with the Voodoo Donut sign but thought ""I might as well just stand in line too because how many times will I really come here."" The wait was roughly around 30 minutes (which is still insane!) and I ordered the infamous voodoo, a jelly donut in the shape of a voodoo doll covered with chocolate. The donut was extremely heavy and the dough was not airy or fluffy at all. On top of that, it was extremely sweet and just not very different from that jelly donut from your local donut shop (and honestly that one may even be better).

It's true, or at least I've convinced myself it's true because if I didn't, I'd be devouring doughnuts with alarming frequency. But even I knew I had to try Voodoo Doughnut because the buzz had been deafening me for years. Even the late, great Anthony Bourdain took notice of them on his previous travel show, 'No Reservations'. So when Jamie W. and I were walking west from the waterfront, we saw young people scurrying about with their signature pink boxes and knew we were close by.

Sure enough there were people at their outdoor tables wolfing down doughnuts, and as luck would have it, the permanent line to get them had an unusual break which we seized. I already told Jamie what we would order since I had been schooled on the must-haves by Voodoo aficionados back home. First up was the $3 Voodoo Doll, a raised yeast doughnut filled with raspberry jelly and covered liberally with a sweet chocolate frosting. It looked like the progeny of Mr. Bill's evil twin and Patrick the Starfish, Spongebob's best bud. We both took one bite each. Definitely softer than I expected. Next was the $3.50 Maple Bacon Bar.

It was another raised yeast doughnut but slathered with a maple frosting and topped with crisped bacon strips. Concept was somewhat better than the execution, but who turns down bacon? Again one bite each. Next was The Loop for $1.95, yet another raised yeast doughnut but this one dipped heavily in a thick vanilla frosting and topped with what appeared to be a bowlful of Fruit Loops. Even though it was Portland Pride weekend and they offered a Gay Bar, the multiple colors raised our freak flag most suitably. This one was actually better than it looked probably because that was my favorite cereal as a child. Nice and sweetly crunchy.

Before you ask, yes, they do offer a Capt'n Crunch version as well. Despite our praise, we stuck to our guns and stayed with one bite each. Last one was a concession to Jamie, the $1.15 Blueberry Cake doughnut which came with a thin glaze. It was clearly the most nondescript of the quartet we ordered, but since it was the only cake of the bunch, it was ironically the most satisfying. But no matter, it was one bite each. Here they are in the box (photo: http://bit.ly/2lAJt77). After taking our somewhat disciplined approach, I asked Jamie rather facetiously, ""That was enough, right?"". He nodded his head, and we left the remains in the box on top of the trash bin. It can be done.

It's really impossible to choose just one donut, so we got a box of four. Even that really wasn't enough to satiate us. I don't think you can go wrong with anything they have to offer. We got the traditional Voodoo (chocolate with raspberry filling), one with white frosting and Fruit Loops on top, one glazed with raspberry filling and (the best) one with Rice Krispies, chocolate and peanut butter.

They have so many creative designs and unique flavors ranging from sweet to savory. There were even funky flavors like NyQuil and pepto, which have since been discontinued. They do still come out with new seasonal flavors. The prices are very affordable; it came out to $9 something for four donuts.

As a chocolate lover, I decided to get two chocolate flavors. The first was the peanut doughnut which has chocolate frosting. The other was a chocolate base with chocolate frosting and chocolate toppings, yum! The Bacon Maple Bar is made with bacon and Maple syrup. It was very different from anything I've tried before. I must admit that the first bite was a bit weird because of the mix of sweet and savory sensations, but it quickly becomes addicting. And of course my final choice would be to try the famous Voodoo Doll. It is a giant donut with jelly filling, chocolate frosting, and a pretzel. Personally I felt that it was way too sweet, especially with all that frosting. My favorites would have to be between the double chocolate and the maple bacon. 

Also, be prepared for long lines! You may be waiting for an hour on average depending on when you go. There's another location with virtually no lines.

When you hear about Portland, you often hear about Powell's bookstore, The Rose Garden, and especially Voodoo Donuts. Voodoo Doughnuts is Portland's biggest and most popular doughnut shop. Being so famous, I knew I had to visit it at least once. There are several Voodoo Doughnut locations but I visited the main Voodoo Doughnut location near Old Town/ChinaTown.

My friend and I visited Voodoo's at around 10:17am and boy was the line long. The sheer amount of people waiting for the line was so long, it could even rival Disneyland lines!

We ended up waiting around an hour until we got to the register. There is a giant menu outside the store and a variety of donuts inside, but I had my game plan for doughnuts ready. One thing that I really loved was the sheer amount of creativity and uniqueness 

My friend and I ordered:
Old Dirty Bastard (Oreos & Peanut Butter), Fruit Loops Doughnut, Voodoo Doughnut (A Chocolate Donut with frosting made to look like a Voodoo Doll and jam filling with a pretzel stick in the middle), and Maple Bacon. And a nice refreshing carton of milk to go with all the awesome donuts.

The Old Dirty Bastard was personally too much for me since I don't enjoy peanut butter. My friend who really likes peanut butter thought that this donut was good but not amazing.
The Fruit Loops Doughnut was so disappointing. The fruit loops on top were stale, and the doughnut itself was sort of plain.
The Voodoo Doughnut was arguably the best doughnut out of my box. The jam inside was a nice addition to the doughnut, and the shape of the doughnut made it fun to eat! I'm also just a giant fan of chocolate doughnuts.
Last but not least, the Maple Bacon. The Maple Bacon is a maple syrup with bacon doughnut. A sweet and salty experience. I personally thought the doughnut itself was good, but the bacon on top was too inconvenient to eat. It was just a giant piece of cold bacon that wouldn't break into pieces easily.

Overall, Voodoo Doughnut is Portland's most famous doughnut store. I think Voodoo's is easily the most unique and creative doughnut place around, but in terms of quality and time I spent waiting in line for these doughnuts, makes this place a visit once and done.",64M69FJCE9Hanm_7ci7G3w,22 SW 3rd Ave,"Local Flavor, Food, Donuts, Wedding Chapels, Event Planning & Services, Bakeries, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch",Portland,45.52261201140001,-122.67308361139999,Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town,97204,9185,3.5,OR,2

After waiting about 30 minutes in the short-but-still-kinda-long-for-doughnuts line, we decided to make our time worthwhile and pick out a half dozen, 3 each.

I got:
- Old dirty bastard: peanut butter and Oreos! Delicious. It was almost too sweet, but I loved the crushed Oreos too much to stop eating it.
- Voodoo doll: cute little VD classic. I'm not a huge fan of jelly filled doughnuts, but the raspberry jam here is pretty good.
- Maple bacon bar: like a regular maple bar, but topped with a generous fatty slice of bacon! And we all know bacon makes everything better.

MM played it safe with:
- Maple bar: like mine but without the bacon. I thought it was kinda lame by comparison, but he liked it.
- Old fashioned: a simple glazed cruller
- Portland creme: I guess it's like a Boston Creme Pie, but Portland?

All in all, they were a bit pricey, but they come in flavors that you just won't find in any ol' doughnut shop!

As others have mentioned, I'm not sure how fairly average doughnut shop has managed to become associated with the very fabric of Portland's being just by throwing some glitter on the wall and selling over-sized boxes.

They have one infamous cream doughnut that looks like a dong, but I think they missed the boat for that being shocking by a good 15-20 years. I'm pretty sure there are erotic bakeries in Chelsea (Manhattan in New York City for the West-Coast lifers) that have reached the point of willing to depict full hardcore pornography on an apple strudel if that's what you want...

Speaking of hard numbers: I waited 40 minutes in line to spend 28 dollars on 13 doughnuts.

As I typed that sentence I gradually became more and more disappointed with my life. 

And yet there were suckers who didn't beat rush-hour and had to wait way longer than I did. 

Spoiler Alert: it's not worth it.

Are the doughnuts bad? I wouldn't go that far. If you gave VDD one star for quality I'd love to read your reviews of a Dunkin Donuts. 

On the other hand, were they great? Not really. Definitely not good enough to go there regularly and deal with the winding line of tourists / adult-onset diabetes.

I do applaud them for being one of the only truly 24-hour businesses in PDX (maybe you can actually avoid the line at 2am?), but at the same time I boo at them for running a cash-only business. Seriously? You're crumbling up an Oreo onto a doughnut (God Bless America) for a 250% markup and I can't earn some frequent flier miles by swiping the plastic? 

You could say it would make the line worse, but no, what makes the line worse is people fumbling at the ATM who can't believe VDD has the same payment requirements as Lucky Devil Lounge. I guess to be fair, both are similar in that you'd be ashamed for your significant other to see the withdrawl statement if you'd gone without them...

At the end of the day though, the most shocking thing about VDD is the blandness. There's nothing magical, nothing that defines Portland, just OK doughnuts sprinkled with an amazing amount of hype and marketing.

I'm not a huge fan of sweets in general, specifically not the over the top sugar rush of most of these doughnuts.  After having one doughnut I realized that the doughnut itself just isn't very good, or perhaps I just got a stale doughnut out of the revolving case. 

It reminds me a lot of the cupcake craze in DC, people waiting in 40 person deep lines for mediocrity.  

Ther service and the prices were actually not that bad but they are cash only, fyi.  I also like that they sell cartons of milk.  

The other obnoxious factor are the tourists, it takes even longer to get a doughnut due to the hordes of large groups taking pictures of anything and everything inside.  I also saw another dozen giant pink boxes at the airport on the way out of town.  The street kids next door and the ominpresent homeless scouring the line for change don't do anything to enhance the experience either.

Sort of like back in the 1980s when you had to stand in line to get concert tickets for that group everybody was excited to see live, except that the Voodoo line moves faster. And none of the people in it are smoking weed.

It is true that they toss the doughnuts into those pretty pink boxes in a manner that causes the glaze to rub off onto the thin wax-paper they use to separate the doughnuts, as some other reviewers have noted.

Haven't tried all the flavors we bought yet, but I do like the pina colada with guava jelly donut. It had coconut flakes on top and guava jelly inside - not too sweet so it was to my likings! The grape ape tasted good too l according to my boyfriend - had a strong grape flavor. Definitely recommend ordering from the top level's donut options on these rotating examples for you to see and choose from. The ones are the top are the fun flavors and much larger in size than he bottom layer ones. My favorite part of this place is the unique exterior and interior decor.

Then, when you eat the donut, you think, so what? Someone paid six dollars for this? If you buy a box of donuts here, some spanger will ask you for a donut within five minutes. 

I went to Voodoo the first (and only) time with a wedding party, where the two evangelical kids tying the knot queued up happily, while I eventually lost interest and went home. The fact that church kids celebrate weddings here tells you a lot about culture in Portland at this moment, although just exactly what, I'd need more space to outline.

The line was fairly long, wrapped around the railing and extended down the street...I think we waited almost an hour for it.

I think it is only worth it if you have a big party and are willing to share all the crazy decorated donuts for a photo op.

Line up.  Join the excitement.  Who doesn't like doughnuts?
This place is a little overwhelming and I'm a little bit OCD.  What flavors do they have, what are they sold out of?  How does this work?  How can you visit Portland and not check out Voodoo Doughnut?

While in line I coerced my companion to get a dozen so that we could keep them in the car in case we got stuck in bad weather.  After leaving Portland we headed to the falls, then to the coast, then to Seattle, then to Leavenworth, then to Tofino.  Those mountain passes can always be a little dicey in November and I just wanted to be prepared!

The line for voodoo snakes around the building.  As you get closer you can peep in the window to see the ""back room"", a few more steps in line and you can see inside the storefront.  Once you get past the threshold you are queued back and forth through a maze of stanchions.  I brought up the menu of flavors on my ipad.  http://voodoodoughnut.com/doughnuts.html I stressed and stressed.  I needed to pick 6/12.  I didn't want to choke when I got to the front.  I felt so much pressure.  I guess the only downfall is that you can't really tell what they have that day until you get to the front and view the spinning, tiered display of doughnuts.  Most people who go there don't have their act together and have no idea what they want or like.  

Bottom line:  I loved the doughnuts and I'm glad they are located across the country from me.  I really loved the Miami Vice Berry and Chocolate Coconut.  You really can't go wrong.

Mango Tango - 5/5. By far my favorite of the bunch! The mango jelly on the inside was delightful (though a bit sweet by my standards) and the tang sprinkled atop the icing/frosting was a unique twist. I'd recommend this to those who enjoy a fruity-flavored donut. 

Maple Bacon Bar - 4/5. Perhaps it's because I don't buy into the bacon trend that has swept the Sates or that I'm less inclined toward a sweet-savory combo, but IF I WERE - I'd say this was a great donut. It wasn't super sweet (much unlike the Voodoo Doll), but had a good balance between the maple icing and bacon strip.

Voodoo Doll - 3/5. Cutting into my Voodoo Doll, I was quite pleased to see it oozing out raspberry jelly from it's abdomen. Clever, really. Otherwise, I was a bit unimpressed because it was just too sweet. It really boiled down to a raspberry jelly-filled donut with extremities and lots of icing.

Definitely a must when in Portland, but next time I might stick with the more extreme versions like grape and fruit loops just because you can't be disappointed with something so creative.

In fact, the inside of the store is kind of grungy and dirty looking.  Perhaps this is because so many people frequent this store.  I didn't think this donut store was all that special.

It may not be for everybody, but I can get past the suggestive and naughty themes of some of their wares to judge their donuts on their own merits.  The true acid test, in my opinion, of any donut shop is to taste their raised, glazed variety.  Voodoo has this down pat!  Slightly firm and doughy, but very airy and soft at the same time.  The flavor is spot-on, and their size is definitely on the generous side.

How are their other varieties?  All of the raised varieties I've tasted, with rare exception, are excellent.  Voodoo is a VERY busy place, so they have a high turnaround, so you're almost guaranteed that what you're getting is EXTREMELY fresh.  Overall, Voodoo offers the best donuts I've had in Oregon.

Why only four stars, if their donuts are so good?  There are a few issues that detract from the perfect rating.

First, they only take cash.  This requires a trip to my credit union if I want to avoid the high charge for use of their ATM.

Second, you may not be able to get in when you want.  On my second visit, they had a ""private"" wedding going on, so we were not allowed to go in.  This irritated me enough to almost not want to come back again.

Third, you pay a BIG premium if you want to pick what donuts you get.  Seriously.  If you order a dozen (you can get a few different pricing tiers of dozens...ranging from about $13 for all cake donuts to $23 for a ""signature"" assortment), they pick all of the donuts.  You can get any variety you want, they just charge you per piece, and they're really overpriced.

Fourth, some of their donuts border on ""ridiculous"".  Any of them with oreo pieces, breakfast cereal, etc, results in the topping getting soggy from moisture encroachment from the frosting.

Overall, Voodoo is an EXCELLENT donut shop.  Their pretentious nature is offputting enough to miss the perfect mark, though.",EyVcCl7Wk_NtDVvdHEB5Vg,22 SW 3rd Ave,"Local Flavor, Food, Donuts, Wedding Chapels, Event Planning & Services, Bakeries, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch",Portland,45.52261201140001,-122.67308361139999,Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town,97204,9185,3.5,OR,1

My girlfriend and I ate them all and we came to the conclusion that they were just alright.  There's nothing extremely special about them, although we cannot say they were bad donuts.  They were just.... OK.

The pricing isn't cheap, so be prepared to drop 2 to 3 bucks on a donut.  Go once to check it out but that's all you really need I'd say.

Sorry, we're from Chicago, but those were the only two things we even knew about Oregon in general. So when we got to Portland, the number one thing on the list was Voodoo Doughnuts. We knew it was a tourist trap going in, but I didn't expect it to be this bad.

The line was not tremendously long, but we did have to wait in the rain for about five minutes before we were allowed inside. That's understandable- it's hyped up, and there has to be some wait even on an early Sunday morning. When we got in, we saw what we had seen on the shows before: the decor, the atmosphere, and, of course, the doughnuts.

The service was nice, and we got out quickly despite the immense wait we saw. We didn't really know what we wanted, but we picked whatever we saw that looked appealing to some groggy travelers.

Fast forward to the hotel, where we started eating the donuts. The first thing that overcame our senses was staleness and loads of sugar. The shop is open 24/7, so the donuts were clearly about a couple days old. They had the texture of about a day old munchkin from Dunkin Donuts, not so hard as a rock but just hard enough to make anyone be like ""woah, this is stale."" The sugar was another big problem. One donut alone probably had all of the sugar recommended in a daily diet. The recipe must have called for one bag of sugar per donut. To top it off, the donuts gave me E-Coli, not a fun thing to have when you're driving down the 101 South through the redwoods.

So, I guess it boils down to ""Would I come back if I was back in Portland?"" And that answer is a definite no. Maybe I'm being a bit biased because of the fact I got sick from the batch of donuts I ate, but the donuts were NOT worth the hype or money spent on them.

I had to see what all the rage was about.  I went on a Sunday late morning and there was a line snaking along the front.  After standing and waiting in line for about 20 min watching customer after customer come out of the store with a large pink box of doughnuts and smiles on their face I realized the signs that read CASH ONLY.  Seriously?  This was a surprise to many as they came close to entering.  Luckily there is an ATM, so you can eat the bank fees on top of your treats.  

Once inside, the cashier was simply not in the mood to be there. The doughnut options are spinning in displays but nothing to indicate what they are exactly.  Luckily there were a few floating menus out front, none of which made it to me, and an app online to read the selections beforehand.  The list is long, the options are so bizarre they require serious study, and frankly my memory is not THAT good.  I refuse to pay ATM fees and limited my order to whatever cash we had on hand the few doughnut options I was able to remember.  The price tag is appropriate for an over-sized popular novelty at the level of your run of the mill tourist trap.  

The result, good doughnut.  Seemed fresh from that morning, they were nice and doughy inside.  I'm glad I came, but I don't need to return.  I come to Portland often and this will not be a regular stop.  The parts that stuck with me the most: long line; poor customer service; high price tag; and a business more interested in avoiding taxes than offering the convenience of accepting credit cards to their customers.

The reason we stopped by was we were at the Saturday Market next block and my wife saw this big line. Both of us are Donut fans so without much thought we joined the big line.

Our first shocker came at how rude the serving lady was. She was the only rude person we met on our entire trip. I am personally very impressed by how fun and laid back Portland people are. My wife told her that this was her first time at Voodoo and asked what their most famous donuts were. The server just made a very fed up face as if she would rather be somewhere else before giving a very generic 'depends on what you like' response.

Anyways, after we bought the donuts, we were shocked to find them completely cold. Who goes to a donut shop to eat cold donuts?! Also, both the donuts we tried (Portland Cream and Raspberry Romeo) were absolute rubbish even though we were starving. 

We loved Portland and every other restaurant or food-cart we ate at. Voodoo was the only and surprising disappointment given the line. Maybe they were just having a bad day. But we are never going back.

My personal favorite is the Portland Cream Donut, it's got a custard-like filling that's very creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. They're fritters are good as well, and they're the size of a baseball glove!

Expect a wait when you go.  Oh. And to give yourself time to find a parking space.  I really think that the wait is part of the charm of the place.  One gets to hear people talk about Voodoo Donuts:  what to expect, when they first heard about it, what they're going to choose and they look around and always find something that I've never seen before.

The counter attendants like to rush it a bit to accommodate the long line of people, often waiting in the rain or the snow.  It's good to know what you will order, but they will help you out, if you need it.

I usually order the Voodoo Dozen, now raised to $10.50, and a voodoo man (with jelly guts) and a Tex-Ass glazed donut.  The most famous donuts are the maple/bacon,  the cock and balls, the Memphis Mafia and the huge Tex-Ass.  Sometimes I order a Stumptown coffee, but at 12:00-1:00 a.m. they usually have a hard time keeping it hot in their thermoses.

You will usually find street kids begging for a donut as you walk to your car.  I always give them one, with no problem to it.

It is unusual inside; one wall is covered in newspaper obituaries of various celebrities; the ATM is even decorated in theme.

The bar is a generic but good risen bar. The maple frosting is very thick, and forms a substantial layer between the bacon and bar. It's very sweet-complaints about excessive sweetness are somewhat justified, but it's a good kind of sweet.

The bacon was quite good, a little chewier than I liked for the application but still on the right side of the chewy-crisp boundary. The maple and bacon worked well together. I could see doing a cake this way, or maybe cupcakes.

Herself also got a plain raised chocolate, which she pronounced very good. I tried a thing called an Old Dirty Bastard, a raised cake donut with peanuts, peanut butter (I think), and melted chocolate on top and running (hardened, as around a candy) down the sides. Very good, very rich.

The store was also super entertaining to look at, the music was fun, the service was good (even with them being super busy with customers all the time, they didn't make you wait more than a minute to buzz you into the bathroom) and even with the long lines, they were pretty speedy.

I go to Voodoo probably once a week downtown, and once a week to their eastside location. 

If your not from Portland you'll be shell shocked when you go to the downtown location. It's great seeing the tourists but here's some advice.

Just get a VooDoo Dozen because you can then try 12-13 of their donuts instead of taking foreverrr to figure out what you want!

I love the TexAss but my new favorite thing is to get the ""tip donut"" (whatever they made up) at their eastside location. If you want to sit down, go to that one. If you want a Portland exp., go downtown. I think the Portland Walking Tours even goes there. 

Always gonna be a line so don't complain and please, please, please, if you're not from our city, don't gawk at the homeless and hippy crowds.

I had two Memphis Mafias (banana fritter with chocolate and pb topping), a bacon maple, PB Oreo, cream cheese peach fritter, mango guava jelly, lemon iced marionberry filled, and an ""eclipsicle"" doughnut (chocolate iced with orange cream filling). 

-Memphis Mafias (banana fritter with chocolate and pb topping: banana chunks weren't very detectable, at all, which was a let down. I'm thinking they wee mashed and blended into the batter but don't expect to have sweet banana chunks. The peanut butter overwhelms the rest of the fritter flavoring. Would not rebuy again.
-Bacon maple: strips of bacon were stale and dry. Maple was less than mediocre. Wouldn't rebuy and didn't even finish eating.
-PB Oreo: cookies were stale and soft--obviously the doughnut had been sitting for hours. Total let down. I've had better from chain doughnut shots and would not rebuy from Voodoo.
-Cream cheese peach fritter: fantastic peach chunks with the blend of slightly salty and tart cream cheese. This was a win.
-Mango guava jelly: fun salty tang on top paired with the unique guava jelly. Would rebuy and was a fun twist.
-Lemon iced marionberry filled:fun and tart topping but the filling was lackadaisical and bland. Definitely a lack of clean punch to tie it all together. Wouldn't necessarily rebuy...
-""eclipsicle"" doughnut (chocolate iced with orange cream filling) this was a fun take, but the mixing of flavors could leave you feeling ill as there's an essence of medicine flavoring that I can't place.

I figured I needed to check the box.  First of all, the doughnuts are complete eye candy.  For anybody impressed by funky designs and bold colors, they are a feast for the eyes.  There are so many to choose from as well, and it can be overwhelming, especially if you're hoping for a perfect match.  I settled on a cake doughnut covered with white icing, topped by crushed Oreos.  All I have to see it was heaven at first bite.  I couldn't believe it.  Before I could exhale, I was nearly finished.  I just couldn't help myself.  I went back another time with an out-of-town guest that was recently visiting.  I made myself try something entirely different.  It was a marshmallow-creme filled doughnut, topped with a chocolate frosting.  Again, I thought I died and went to Nirvana.  Every bite, every morsel was perfect.

They have a doughnut with BACON, and I don't man bacon sprinkles or little bits of bacon or something.  No, the Bacon Maple Bar actually has a strip of bacon atop the maple icing.  (And their maple icing couldn't be more maple-y if it had actual pieces of a fresh maple tree in it!)

As for the rest of my review, I knew this place had to have some serious cred when I found myself standing in a 15 minute line at 10am on a Wednesday (903 Yelp reviews also lends some cred...).  There's a massive selection of gourmet bagels, my only gripe being that I didn't see many descriptions (did I miss a paper menu somewhere?).  Some of the displays had short description placards, though (including the Marshall Mathers, which had mini M&Ms and vanilla frosting).  This was a fun detour, though.  I'd recommend going with a few people, so you can get a few and pass 'em around, because I think most people would have a hard time eating more than one of these sugar-bombs in a sitting.

First, it's cheaper than cupcakes.  With most options ranging between $1.25-$2.50, Voodoo is half the price of Sprinkles and Georgetown Cupcakes.  Second, it offers the opportunity for more complex toppings and flavors.  Cupcakeries are too conservative to offer a maple bacon cupcake?  Granted, should someone bake it, I shall eat that too.  Third, donuts offers a more balanced treat than cupcakes.  The unsweetened fried dough is a foil to its sugary toppings unlike the unadulterated sugar-on-sugar combination of cupcakes.

Tourist Trap or not, Voodoo Doughnut is one place you shouldn't miss.  Plus, it's open 24 hours so you can beat the crowds by coming in at 5am.  [Original Visit: December 18, 2010]

- 1 powdered raspberry filled 
- 1 captain captain
- 1 voodoo doll

But until they requisition all the maple bars for their evil and nefarious experiments, I will enjoy the delight of the maple doughnut at Voodoo.  The Voodoo doughnut was ok; the pretzel was soft (blech) and there was too much red jelly, making it messy and too sweet.  Funny concept, ""meh"" on execution.

What I didn't like:
1.  Don't ignore me while I'm standing there trying to get my doughnut groove on, and don't have conversations with other people til you are finished helping me.  That's rude.
2.  Don't put my doughnuts in a bag and squish them.  Why not give me a bag for each?  Instead you put both in the same bag and my poor Voodoo man was squished and most of the frosting was rubbed off.  Uncool.
3.  For the love of all that is sacred and holy, PLEASE wear something other than low rise jeans and a half shirt, especially if you are a man.

It's the kind of place you see on Food Network and hear by word of mouth by everyone who has ever been to Portland. And I know, not everything advertised heavily is automatically great. Being from Boston, I am used to hearing highly of places I wouldn't even look twice at. But I have to admit, Voodoo is worth the hype its given.

Granted, the line is very long. But if you don't mind waiting a bit (and it really is only a bit, since they have three cashiers at a time cycling through the line), then the pay off is rewarding. Once inside, you see an expansive menu of donuts, from something as simple as a ""maple bar"" to more ""out there"" varieties like the ""gay bar"" and ""giant peach,"" both of which we sampled, as well as the ""voodoo doll"" that they are famous for--a chocolate glazed, ghost-shaped donut with a jelly center that is being stabbed by a pretzel stake. Awesome. Every donut listed shares space on rotating pedestals where they are showcased to the line, and from there you can see how different and complex some varieties are. Because the menu is so developed, these really help to narrow the options down. It also led me to choose the ""Homer Simpson,"" a simple strawberry-frosted with sprinkles, a nostalgic novelty with great icing that tasted like Dunkin Donuts if they were still independently owned.

We only waited about 15 minutes or so and ordered smoothly, getting a really cute pink box with their logo and five delicious donuts inside. They all tasted fresh, taken from the array of racks in the back of the store, where employees were working on them behind the scenes.

Actually, the doughnut is not truly exceptional. However, the concept is unique and cool. Having so many different kind of things as topping for doughnut is one of a kind.
Having said that, I like the doughnut. Of course it is better than whatever doughnut you can find in some grocery store, but it is not a lot better than any other specialty doughnut store.

My favorite here is Oreo Doughnuts and Portland Cream.
The line will be crazy !!! So, if you are craving for this, just come around 9 PM or more and there is almost no line around this time. But close to midnight, the line will start piling again and again.

If you come to Portland, you have to try this so when people ask you ""did you try Voodo Doughnut ?"" you can answer ""Of course""

Let me tell you, they were all amazing! The Voodoo Doll Doughnut was a must-try for obvious signature reasons. It was not overbearing in chocolate, and there was a plentiful amount of raspberry fill which was great. The Mango Tango was also fairly decent and flavorful. As for the Blueberry Cake, THIS IS A MUST HAVE. They were so amazing! The cake just crumbles in your mouth and it's not too sweet or under sweet which had a perfect balance. Just a very light glaze which made it even better. This is definitely one of the best doughnuts I have had in my life.

TL;DR: CASH ONLY, great doughnut variety, little under the hype

Ah yes, the Portland spot that almost everyone talks about. I couldn't ask anyone for suggestions without hearing about this donut place. Voodoo Doughnuts does have a lot of hype and the variety to back it up. However, I didn't find their doughnuts to be too out of the ordinary. Yes, I'm glad I went here, but I'm not sure it's something I'd go out of my way for.

I had the Portland Cream and the Viscous Hibiscus.

PORTLAND CREAM (4/5)
- Good filling, but not too filled
- Average chocolate doughnut taste
- Pretty good size for the price

VISCOUS HIBISCUS (3/5)
- Really sweet, but I don't know what else to expect
- Half sprinkles looks good, but kinda awkward to eat
- Huge doughnut!

I was a huge fan of the service! Even with the line, the cashier was really helpful and explained some of the doughnuts. We were able to order our doughnuts and get out of the store pretty quickly. We didn't know that this shop was Cash Only, but luckily, I had some cash on me. Important to know before you come. I think the novelty of this place is great, but I'm not sure I'd come back again.

It seemed as if they were leaving town and they just HAD to get a box of voodoo donuts before they left town. This was very odd. 

I also noted that all the 5 star reviews of Voo Doo donuts originate from locals that live in the Portland area. As if they have all been collectively brainwashed to gravitate towards this place come rain or shine. 

We waiting for about 20 minutes to actually get up to the counter and as we were waiting we heard one of the employees tell a customer "" I don't give a sh*t if you take an hour to select your donuts, these people can wait here forever for all I care"" . Excellent, I thought! 

When we finally got to the register, we selected 8 of their most popular donuts including the one with bacon. The donuts were good but NOT worth standing in line for so long. And definitely not worth $2.50 a piece. 

Additionally, the bakery and premises were absolutely filthy. The employees were filthy. None of them were wearing hairnets or gloves. The girl who served us looked like she hadn't bathed in days.

No FDA food codes were posted. And they do not accept credit cards.

Honestly, people probably only go for the Instagram pictures because I was not impressed by anything here at Voodoo. The only reason we even STOPPED here was we were looking for Chinatown (which was a dud) and voodoo was right there in front of us. 

The line was short, so the Jen W. and I decided to beeline for it. Standing there, it reminded me of a chinese bakery where the fruitcakes just sit in the center of the store between the cashiers and spin in circles. The donuts were doing the exactly same thing, on a platter spinning and spinning. The decor was pink inside that screamed look at me and give yourself a headache. 

I was really thrown off by the LACK of service here. There were no signs as to what they offered, or what each of the donuts on display was. The girl helping us was in no mood to and we were just trying to find out what's good in the hood. We asked for their ""famous"" donut and she suggested the Maple Bacon- and so we did. Not impressed because I don't care for donuts like that, bacon was dried and fried to an ashy crisp, and the donut wasn't even fluffy on the inside. 

The hype lacked realness and it's really for the pictures. I mean they looked better than they tasted. I wouldn't waste my time through TSA to bring you back VD's.

The downtown location is small and parking is always hard to come by, but if you park in Chinatown and are willing to walk a couple blocks to get there then it's no biggie.

The only downside to voodoo is probably the staff. I've never gotten a friendly vibe from any of them, which is probably just because they are always so incredibly busy in there.

To showcase some of their more interesting doughnuts, all of which I have tried and loved:

Old Dirty Bastard - a raised doughnut with chocolate topping, crushed oreos and peanut butter drizzle

Bacon Maple Bar - yes... it's real bacon. Your standard maple bar with two lovely, crispy and fresh strips of bacon on top. Get over the weird and get with the bacon... this is amazing

Cock n Balls - this is your basic raised doughnut with chocolate topping.... cream-filled, of course! They will even put custom writing on top if you want. It's like $5 and could feel a family of four. Go for it!

Then, there are various raised and cake/frosted doughnuts with toppings such as oreos, Captain Crunch, Cocoa Puffs, Rice Crispies, pixie stix, bubble gum, marshmallows, and yes.... even Tang.

One big word to the wise.... they only take CASH... so come prepared. Prices per doughnut range from about $1 each to $5, and I think a dozen is around $15 if you pick them out yourself. I highly recommend this every time you are in Portland.

They are located next door to a porno theater and across the street from a strip join on the edge of china town.

Only get the fruit powdered ones (Mango Tango, Grape Ape) if you're craving the super-sweet.  The cereal topped treats are great, if you like that particular cereal, that is.

They do have a ton of options here, might as well get at least a dozen! All of their flavors are listed on a chalkboard on the wall, but some of the uniquely named ones don't have descriptions, so you might just have to wing it. There's a rotating donut case too if you want to decide by looks instead of description. I didn't want anything crazy but nothing boring either, so I went with the Portland cream donut, nicely described as ""Portland's official doughnut."" Sounds good to me...and it was! It's chocolate glazed and inside there's a custard-type of cream... it almost reminded me of a Boston Cream Pie. The donut tasted dense and fresh, no wimpy grocery store donuts here. I also tasted my boyfriend's Voodoo donut and the Mango Tango donut. The Voodoo donut is more for its looks - since they decorate it just like a Voodoo doll. Tasty, but it's basically just a chocolate frosted donut. The Mango Tango donut was really good though - packed with mango flavored jelly and topped with a thick glaze.

I was most shocked by how GOOD the prices are at this place.  As such a hyped up, must-see Portland attraction, I expected the prices to be overpriced but they weren't.  I don't remember the exact prices, but there were many doughnuts that only cost around a dollar each.

I ordered a ""Voodoo Doll,"" which was great!  It's a doughnut shaped like a little voodoo doll, with a little pretzel stick you use to poke at it and see the jelly filling ooze out.  I also ordered a Portland Cream which was amazing, and a glazed French Crueller, also good.

I'd give this place SIX stars if I could!

Jokes aside, I decided to see what the hype was about...and found out that it's just that, hype. 

After waiting over fifteen minutes (only three people in front of me. But the hipster clerk wouldn't let anyone else pay until a customer used the ATM to get cash), I finally ordered my two doughnuts (bacon maple bar, and regular maple bar), and payed almost five bucks(!) for the two. Now that should have payed for two doughnuts, plus coffee at any other place, but I figured that the doughnuts should be good enough, right? Not quite.

Simply put, the doughnuts were nasty. The bacon tasted old, and the icing was way, way too sweet. To the point where I felt like vomiting afterwards. I couldn't even finish the second doughnut, because the sweetness was just killer. Some of you may think I am a wuss...but come on, try it yourself and see. I'd like to see you choke down two of the maple bars. And if you do...join the forces of Wilford Brimley in fighting diabeetus.

There was another hipster behind the counter, who did not open up a second register to help out the long line, and seemed to just sit and stare into space. What was his job? I honestly don't know. 

I don't understand the shit-craze everybody has for Voodoo. Everyone makes it sound like it's super original and trendy, but in all truth the doughnuts are sub-par and pricey. Clerks are super rude, they only take cash, the lines are long...and just the simple fact that it's overrated. It is just like those cupcake places that have sprung up in every metropolitan area.

Being new here I had not been to Voodoo yet either. I wouldn't wait in line for it if I didn't have an out of towner with me with a time frame, especially with the camp out of people asking for change on the corner where the line wraps around the block. That's just annoying, especially when they're parked under the only spot that's covered when it's raining. I also got a $60 parking ticket for not backing my car in the spaces just out front. It was raining, and I was parked between two big SUV's (one parked front in and one backed in) in my little car so I couldn't see the two signs on the ends of this parking strip that said to back in. I'm hoping they will let me off if I take a picture into the courthouse that shows that I really couldn't see that sign. 

Despite all of that, it is a fun place if only because it's different. I like independent businesses that figure out how to do so well selling things as simple as donuts! The staff doesn't have time for you to be a slow wishy washy goober at the counter but they weren't ever rude. They weren't overly nice, but there's a lot of potential to be rude and the staff was generally pretty nice. After reading reviews, waiting at least 20 minutes in line, and just seeing the set up, I was happy to not have to face a tragically hip jerk at the counter. They were out of the first 4 donuts I wanted to try but egh... it's a doughnut! It's not like they don't have a variety AND they did tell me that more were coming up if I wanted to wait. 

There was a little poster with just a very few donuts with descriptions on it by the glass case. With how busy it gets I'm blown away that they don't have more of those up to help people decide while they wait in line!!! I have to believe it would make the line go so much faster! I'd probably give them that last star just for that since the line situation is ridiculous and there's a pretty simple solution that would at least make it better. OH, AND CASH ONLY!!

As do Voodoo Doughnuts innuendos.  And they are very well marketed; the magic, IS indeed in the hole.

My top 3 favorites are: 
Maple Bacon Bar- those flavors go so perfectly together.
Gay Bar-  There are fruit loops on this donut. 
Grape Ape- lavender and grape!  Oh yes yes.  I love these flavors together too. 

The best thing about these donuts is the fact that they are always FRESH.  The dough practically melts in my mouth.  

Today it was raining and there was absolutely no line.  Usually I can see it from a mile away.  I call it the VDL: Visible Doughnut Line.   But today- none.  I had reached Mecca.  Through the wind and the rain.  Donning a broken umbrella.  And it was worth it, every step of he way. 

Best conversation from strangers: 
Homeless Man: ""You have a pink box."" Me: ""I am well aware."" Homeless man: ""You have some sugar on your chin."" Me: ""I was unaware, but I think I'll just keep it there. Thanks, though."" Homeless Man: ""Have a great day.""

Second best conversation- Lady on hotel elevator: ""Oh my! Voodoo donuts! I hear all about those on the food network! Is it worth the walk? How far is it? How many donuts are in that box? Do you work for the airlines?"" Me: ""Yes, .7 miles according to my phone, 13, yes.""

It was brightly colored with lots of photos on the wall and had a cool chandelier type light.  By the time we got up to the spot to order we had already made our selections long before.  So it was with great sadness that they told me that they were out of the lemon chiffon that I wanted.  As a quick backup selection I ended up ordering the maple bacon bar.  We then made it to the register and paid our cash (it's a cash only place) before heading outside to sit at one of their tables.  The doughnut portion of my bar ended up being fresh and really good while I also enjoyed the bacon.  What I didn't enjoy as much was the maple frosting which i found to be a bit too sweet for me.

They get an extra star for creativity, with doughnuts such as bubble gum, captain crunch, the Gay bar, and even Cock and Balls (although I more than likely would never order it) I thought it was funny.

Who do they think they are? The Doughnut Nazi's? Only reason we tried this the first time is because I wanted a vegan doughnut while we were visiting. My husband went to pick them up and when he came back he was a little annoyed. The guy behind the counter was super rude and the line was long. I was surprised that my doughnuts weren't that good and he said neither were his non vegan ones. 

We moved to the Portland area and went again recently after a day walking around town and eating Delicious Thai Cart Food (with awesome service). After waiting in a line for about 30 minutes we get up there and there is only one guy doing the cash register and getting the doughnuts. He's got an attitude like he wishes he wasn't there and he's doing us a favor. We order our doughnuts and I have to scrape the frosting off of mine because it is unbearably sweet. 

Then just today I went down there to get three dozen for my daughters bday tomorrow in class. Line was only about three people out the door. Once I got up to the front there I got a blank stare from a skinny chick that could double as a meth head ( I know I'm being mean). I told her I needed three dozen and I swear she rolled her eyes and sighed. I asked if she had a dozen chocolate glazed vegan doughnuts and she looks at me so perturbed and says ""no"". So I said, OK, how much you got. She actually starts getting them and then realizes that she does have them. Then I point to above them and say and ask for a dozen of the plain glazed. She snaps at me ""are they vegan? If they are, you have to tell me or I'm gonna give you non vegan!"" Again, maybe too much meth? It didn't get much better as I picked the remaining. She took my money when I was done and her ""thanks"" was very phony. I walked out of there and swore they would never get any of my money ever again. 

Now I can imagine if their doughnuts were the best around but they are not. My husband gets the non vegan ones and says Krispy Kreme is much better. The vegan ones aren't that great either. Especially the powder. Made me ill. And I just get the feeling that if they are going to treat me that bad when I'm ordering maybe the doughnuts aren't even vegan.

First hearing about it from Anothony Bourdain and his encounter with the ""Maple Bacon Bar"", I made that my doughnut of choice.  It was a little to sweet for my liking and I could have done without the bacon but I still enjoyed it.  The doughnut itself was soft and moist, not doughy.  My friend had the ""No Name"".  I loved it, it was like a different take on a s'more.

I have tried just about every doughnut on the menu and can narrow it down to a top three: The Memphis Mafia, Miami Vice and McMinnville Cream.

VooDoo wins for fun and comfort.

I am not a fan of the super sweet frosting and topping overload but it keeps me from overeating!  These doughnuts are soft, moist and made fresh.  A plus in my book! They also provide a vegan selection.

A must when traveling with young adults and the young at heart!

It's as though my body is in a race with itself to die from pleasure: Will the sugar rush it into a diabetic coma before the butter/fat/etc. brings on the kind of spectacular coronary that struck my grandfather dead while mowing his lawn 8 years ago? Who cares! I'll still die happier and fuller than gramps did! Except for that third donut I'll never eat...

Voodoo had been so over-hyped to me by the time I got there that I was a little disappointed: Dingy homeless-chic decor, surly (*pre-caffienated?)hipster counterstaff, and the donuts look kinda... sorry, sad, malformed? but tasty? Nothing so slickly produced and attractively-manufactured looking as a Dunkin'-type. No, these little guys are delicious-looking special needs children made with lots of sloppy love - maybe ganja-fueled sloppy love? Now that I think of it, why doesn't Voodoo have a Mary Jane donut? That'd certainly start MY workday off right... Oh, damned laws!

I digress.

I echo all the donut-specific comments made before now - particularly the bacon-maple bar - so bacon-riffic it could test the will of the kosherest of the khosher.

Captain crunch/fruit loops donut was overly sweet. The cereal was getting kind of stale when I ate my donut.
Maple bacon bar was okay. I guess if you're into sweet+salty you'd like this.
The roadkill was probably my favorite one out of all of the ones I tried. Oreos, creme filling, and chocolate glaze. Can't go wrong.

Their dough is pretty soft, but it was something about the frosting/glaze. I felt like I was developing cavities with every bite. The glaze was extremely thick and it was hard to taste everything else because it was so overpowering.

My initial opinion? Overhyped as hell. But yesterday's experience was awesome. It's so unfortunate to see the pandemic and panhandling wear down this business and the surroundings. Voodoo is like the ONLY thing open and booming in the entire area. 

Standing in line (6 feet apart) from other patrons, I was accosted for money at least 20 times in 10 minutes. About 12 of those times were from the SAME lady. It was very annoying. I know it's reality of the current downtown but, it's such an eye sore. 

Went in, such friendly bubbly customer service. The usual nice display windows showing you their unique selections. Chose my voodoo dozen and was out. 

Stood outside for another 5 mins after purchase as my friend was inside picking out her goods. I was accosted 5+ more times by 5+ different people. One of the homeless men aggressively threw their coat down at the ground next to me and security rushed him. Gently pushing him down the street to ""get away"". Security came back apologizing. 

This is a public downtown street. Downtown is f$-""&d up. There's not much they can do. But they did everything they can.

We ordered a mix of their traditional and crazy topping doughnuts. The buttermilk and cream filled ones were nothing out of the ordinary. They tasted good, but were not memorable. The other two that we got were the Captain Crunch and the famous bacon maple doughnut. The Captain Crunch one was topped with an incredibly sweet white frosting and Captain Crunch and berries cereal. The actual doughnut was soft and fluffy, but we could not finish it because of all the sugar. Talk about sugar high! The bacon maple doughnut was hands down our favorite of the bunch. The flavor of the maple frosting with the bacon were a perfect match and wasn't as sweet as the Captain Crunch one.

The first thing you notice when walking in is that this place is old and dungy. It doesn't look clean and the lighting is horrible. The customer service there is horrendous. They yelled at our group for standing in front of the door. If they don't want people standing in front of the door of a cramped 
 and overcrowded area they should set up line barriers to prevent this from happening. Yelling at customers doesn't really make the experience enjoyable. 

When we were called up to make our order we were met by a guy that was dressed very funky and was tattooed all over. I mean on his face, arms, and anything that was visible. I honestly was intrigued by all his tattooes. He had these knuckles tattoos with a line in between each knuckle followed by dots between the other knuckles on each finger. I had never seen that before so i asked what it meant. He looked at me and said ""you don't know!?"" to which i shook my head to indicate that i did not. He then said very rudely, ""if you don't know then you will never know!"" and walked away in disgust. He said it with such anger i was left there staring at the ugly pink walls of the shop in disbelief of what just happened. It was an eerie feeling being there to begin with and now it was a bad experience that kept turning worse. 

Now, i was hoping the doughnuts would redeem the bad experience. I tried the bacon maple doughnut. The doughnut tasted old and the bacon was dry and lacked flavor. To top it all off it wasn't reasonably priced either. 

Then what sealed the deal was that our group decided to eat our doughnuts a block away from the shop standing on the sidewalk. While eating them,  there was a man in his late 20s or early 30s standing about 5 feet away from us. We didn't think anything of it. He tried to make small talk with us but we kept to ourselves. A minute later we see him shooting up some heroin right in front of us. This was in the late afternoon and in public. 

Overall, I would give this entire experience 0 stars if it were possible. I will never step foot inside a VooDoo Doughnut shop again.

A very popular small doughnut place owned by two guys named Kenneth Pogson & Tres Shannon. This place is open 24/7 except on major holidays. It currently has a total of 3 locations in Portland only.

We went here for a late snack around 2:00 am & the line was still long! They were trying to control the number of people coming in, so they let a few in first. There's also few merchandise (like t-shirts, sweatshirts, underwear, etc.) for sale. The interior is very colorful. You can see a lot of pink color (like their boxes) which I like. :) There's a big doughnut display hanging...so cute! Forget about the word ""diet"" when you come here haha! Everything's very sweet, rich & filling.

So far I had tried the following :

* Grape Ape Doughnut - w/ vanilla frosting, grape dust & lavender sprinkles. My fave so far!
* Old Dirty Bastard doughnut - w/ chocolate frosting, Oreos & peanut butter. My friends loved this one. Too rich for me though.
* Voodoo Bubble doughnut - w/ vanilla frosting, bubble gum dust & a piece of bubble gum on top! My second fave. 
* Old Fashioned doughnut - glazed cake doughnut. 
* Cock-N-Balls - w/ Bavarian cream topped w/ chocolate frosting. 
* Voodoo Doll doughnut - w/ raspberry jelly topped w/ chocolate frosting & a pretzel stake. This looked so cute & funny! But was yummy as well.
* Bacon Maple Bar doughnut - w/ maple frosting & bacon on top. 

Vegan options available! Now, everyone's happy. :)

Cons: cash only. There are ATMs nearby.

What I did experience was an extremely short line, amazing and courteous staff members and giant fluffy donuts. There are so many varieties of creative doughnuts and traditional doughnuts, it takes up two full chalkboards of writing. The vibe doesn't disappoint and the carousel of donuts does a decent job giving you some insight into what your choices are. 

I chose a ""Captain my Captain"" (Dead Poet Society anyone?) and enjoyed a glazed vanilla donut with Captain Crunch and Fruit Loops at the same time. It's quite the novelty eating donuts and cereal at the same time and it proved to be too much for me. It was filling and sweet but by the time I got to the center of the city, I had no room for the exciting food carts.

The sheer selection can be a little overwhelming, but there's always something for everyone. I personally gravitate towards the fruitier flavors, and have never been disappointed by Grapve Ave, Mango Tango, Raspberry Romeo, or The Vice. However if you're there for a one-time deal, I would recommend trying their specialties like the Voodoo Doll or Maple blazer blunt. 

At the end of the day they are amazing doughnuts but the wait times often makes me question the worth of it all; as there are many other doughnut places.

I arrived around 9:30 am on a Friday morning and fortunately didn't have to wait in line more than about 15 minutes. Things move pretty quickly and will move even faster if you check Yelp before walking inside to better help you make your doughnut selection. Donuts are super cheap, ranging from .95 to about $2.75. Unfortunately the biggest drawback is that there are no descriptions about the different doughnut flavors- just funny names, so again, check Yelp to help you navigate the menu. 

I chose the Miami Vice which is coated in blue raspberry frosting and pink sprinkles. It was a little bit sweeter than expected but delicious none the less. I washed it down with a 12oz drip coffee and couldnt have been happier.

They really aren't that great, lines are always long, and the donuts are expensive. There is someone out there placing spells on everyone that visits Portland that makes us visit VooDoo Doughnuts -- we just don't want to believe it.

They do offer quirky donut designs, and unique flavors, but they may be overdoing it a bit. It's like when I go to to FroYo Shop, and majority of my FroYo is toppings vs actual FroYo. And what is up with all this blow-me, cock-n-ball, penis shaped donuts? It's like I am in a porn shop for donuts.

The service is a little lacking as well. The people behind the counter seemed bored and uninterested. I don't know if that's how people are in Portland (not my first occurrence), but for such a touristy spot... they should at least try to care. Be happy, and sell us donuts with pride! lol

The donuts are not terrible, but I don't think they are necessarily worth the 30+ minute wait and price. We have our own specialty donut place in San Diego called Donut Bar, and although they do not have voodoo and penis designs (thank goodness!), they do have unique flavors and designs as well. I think our donut joint taste better, is safe for all ages and we don't believe in all that voodoo magic stuff. lol.

TIPS
-- They are open 24/7, so don't stop by during the rush hour
-- Cash only. There are nearby ATMs.
-- If you buy any cereal donuts, don't wait too long before you eat it because they will get stale.
-- I read on someone else's Yelp that they offer a bucket of ""Day Old Donuts"" for $10. I may look into that if I ever stop by Voodoo Doughnuts again. I just hope they are all family-friendly items.

- Bacon Maple Bar: each bite was exploding with a prominent maple flavor with the addition of a slight bacon flavor.

Dirt: It was essentially a cookies and cream donut that had vanilla frosting and Oreo cookies on top. This donut was pretty good and what you would expect out of a donut of this sort. It was on the sweeter side tho.

The Loop: This donut had vanilla frosting topped with fruit loop cereal. This one was my favorite out of the three, however, the cereal tasted stale and not crunchy at all. Even then, I still enjoyed the taste.

Mango Tango: this donut was filled with mango jelly and topped with vanilla frosting. This donut was pretty decent but my least favorite out of the three. The jelly was thick and a little too much for my liking. Even then, the donut was decent.

I agree with most critics who say the donut itself is rather ordinary.  You never get one hot (like Krispy Kreme when they come right off the conveyor) and the base unit can be greasy, as I experienced during my last visit to Portland.  I also concur that the people behind the counter leave much to be desired...rude, and downright obnoxious.  That said, when the base unit is combined with the other ingredients, some surprising stuff can happen.  I'm generally not a fan of donut creativity--but there were a couple donuts in their selection that were great flavor combinations.  Others were absurdly stupid combinations of anything they could find in a grocery store that will stick to a donut--just for the sake of having a donut that's ""different"" from other donuts.  I think the popularity of Voodoo--and their success is due more to the novelty of putting breakfast cereal on donuts than the quality of their baked goods.  That also being said, on a good day, many of their fritters and donuts are at least as good as the best donuts in the US.  On my last visit, I took the Texas-ASS donut challenge--attempted to eat their gigantic glazed donut (the equivalent of a dozen) in 90 seconds (I think).

""Just say no to Voodoo Doughnuts."" Noelle W.

On our long road trip Voodoo Doughnuts was definitely on our list of places to try. We parked around the corner which was a short 5 minute walk to the doughnut shop. Passing the dive bars and restaurants my senses were offended by the smoke from the local patrons.

We stood in a rather long line. Most of this line was comprised of locals and a few tourists. The people in front were definitely hippie like and had the worst body odor ever. I was not going to be deterred. I was on a mission. That mission- to get a dozen of these Voodoo Doughnuts. We finally were ready to order. I picked three Portland Creams, three cinnamon sugar, two Voodoo Dolls, two Bacon Maple Bars and two Neapolitan. The only doughnut that tasted decent was the Portland Creams- delicious chocolate frosting and amazing Bavarian Cream. I saw the customer service person take our doughnuts from the racks and they seemed fresh. The doughnuts were extremely dry almost to the point of stale. 

CONS
~The flies flying above in the foyer.
~The dirty and smelly foyer.
~The fact the customer service person told me while picking my doughnuts, ""You don't have to order one dozen."" Whereby I replied, ""I want to order one dozen of your doughnuts.""
~When I inquired about purchasing a t-shirt the disgruntled employee rolled their eyes, quickly walked away and quickly came back to say, ""No we don't have any more.""
~The dry and staleness of the doughnuts.
~Cash Only.

PROS
~If you've never been here and are lucky to read my review- save your money and taste buds, just skip it.

Really, the line to wait for Voo Doo Doughnut on a Saturday morning over Labor Day weekend was 75 minutes long. Seventy-Five-Fucking-Minutes of my time that was entirely all too worth every damn second. Yes, it was worth it. Would I wait in that line again, probably not. But visiting Portland, everyone has to try this place at least once. The magical question of the 75 minute wait was ""do these doughnuts have drugs in them?"" These people go crazy over a cracked out doughnut?

So no, there are no drugs in the doughnuts, but you really feel like it when you have a 5 minute long moment of euphoria and tingles all over your body after consuming a maple bacon bar or ODB (Old Dirty Bastard).

The thought of doughnut has never been appealing to me. This, my friends, was seriously mind blowing. 
The place is open 24/7, which is good if you want donuts after a night out partying, for breakfast or just for no reason at all because you are a free human and if you want donuts at ungodly hours you might as well get them!!! 
We ordered 3, and it was hard not to order more for 2 adults trying to not gain a million pounds while eating our way through Portland. The lady behind the counter was so kind and helpful (and she had a great style) helped us narrow down the sugar bombs that would become ours. We ordered 2 dough-y ones: a dirty old bastard with vanilla frosting, cookie crumbs and peanut butter drizzle and a dirt one, vegan I believe with vanilla frosting and crushed Oreos. We also ordered a cake one, much smaller and more reminiscent of your traditional donut, with crushed up butterfingers on top, our Voodoo representative's favorite! 
Have I said OMG yet?!! While all 3 of them were to die for, the big ones were our favorite. The texture of the dough was very light and fluffy, it reminded me of a delicate brioche bread. The toppings were decadent and outrageously amazing. It's the bomb. 
I have heard that there is a rivalry for the best donuts in town between Voodoo and the Blue Star, and Voodoo definitely takes the medal by miles! (We compared... haha).

I may be bringing down some bad juju on me for saying this, but Voodoo Doughnuts is an overhyped tourist trap. Yes, the donuts look creative and cute, but taste-wise, there is nothing special here that your local Southeast-Asian-owned doughnut shop most likely named Happy Donut cannot duplicate.

The original location is in what was the old Chinatown, steps from the waterfront and the Willamette River. After stopping by the Portland Saturday Market a block over, we noticed tourist after tourist carrying around those Pepto Bismol pink boxes. So, the wife and I finally caved and reluctantly decided to try Voodoo. 

Surprisingly, the line moves pretty quickly and the inside of the store is decorated with a ton of cool stuff. Also, the workers were really nice. Sadly, that is where the positive experiences ended. 

We got the Voodoo Doll, The Homer, and the Bacon Maple Bar. The Voodoo Doll is definitely Insta-worthy. However, the raspberry jelly was way too sweet and is probably what is going to kill you more than the pretzel stake. The Homer, named after Homer Simpson, is a doughnut with strawberry frosting and sprinkles that was alright. And, the Bacon Maple Bar was good, but it's something that I've had at other doughnut shops. 

After sharing three diabetes-inducing donuts, the wife and I immediately had to eat the yuzu ramen next door even though we weren't even hungry. You see, we needed to balance all that sugar with some soup. 

At the end of the day, Voodoo appears to be magical for some since they have expanded across America from Hollywood to Austin, Denver to Orlando. But for me, I prefer doughnuts that are not so sugary.",j1981ubRRPjeRTx9UkMJ5g,22 SW 3rd Ave,"Local Flavor, Food, Donuts, Wedding Chapels, Event Planning & Services, Bakeries, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch",Portland,45.52261201140001,-122.67308361139999,Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town,97204,9185,3.5,OR,3

""A must try in Portland"" Who ever even came up with that? VD is definitely all hype and doesn't live up to it's name. We waited 50 minutes, 50 MINUTES for this nasty donut place because people said ""a must try"" and we fell for their voodoo...

So were expecting it to be at least decent because it can't surely be good if it's just spitting out thousands of donuts a day for the big crowd. We got 6 donuts: maple bacon, voodoo, portland creme, dick and balls, lemon filling one, and a glazed with raspberry filling. My god, these were all horrible! The only thing we found decent was the plain glazed with raspberry filling, because it wasn't drench in all nasty frosting! The dick and balls were a waste, nothing special, not even decorative. Literally just a molding of a dick and balls. The maple bacon was drenched in maple frosting that literally overwhelmed the bacon slice on there. The lemon filling donut was okay... nothing great. And the voodoo special one was just plain nasty. That was a handful of wet sugar. The portland creme donut was the grossest thing ever. The creme tasted like some other ""creme"" it had a nasty flavor to it. Also the guy gave us a small box for 6 big donuts and everything got a little of everything on it. Seriously dude? The donuts look like it was sitting for awhile...that probably explains why it was also dry inside. Eating the donuts between 3 people, we felt sick to our stomach. The sweetness was just too much. And me, I LOVE SUGAR but they just overdo it. 

I had MUCH better donuts in LA. Heck, I think Krispy Kreme makes better glazed ones! It's not soaking in frosting. It was so disgusting. We will never ever wait 50 minutes for a handful of wet sugar again.

Voodoo doughnuts was one of those places that we were eager to try based on the rave reviews we heard from friends and family.

First of all the queue was really long and hot (you have to wait in the huge line that wraps outside, and when it is 90 degrees with no shade, 20 minutes can seem like a long time.  When you finally reach the door, the people behind the counter are yelling at the people in line to leave enough room for the people who just purchased to get out (seems like poor planning on their part when there was plenty of room to wrap the line the other way and not have this door issue.)

Because the inside is so small, you have approximately 2 minutes to look over dozens of flavors and decide what you want before a horn goes off at the counter and you are expected to come with your order ready. (There is also no AC inside which is kind of disgusting when you realize all the doughnuts are sitting there in the heat all day)

In spite of all this, we were still eager to try it and ordered 4 different kinds.  All of the doughnuts were just short of ""Blah"" and not just in my opinion (I know I am a little skewed by admitting that I don't eat sugar) but also from my husband who eats enough on a consistent basis for both of us (plus a little extra for good measure.)

So, after a disastrous experience at Bunk Sandwiches (hated them!!) the hubby just had to have Voodoo Doughnuts because as with Bunk he had seen them featured on TV; so off we went. 

Not being used to the many one way streets we literally drove around in circles before turning down the correct street and luckily we found parking right in front of the shop. 

Once we arrive we were surprised to see a line wrapped around the building and though ""these donuts must rock!""  We eagerly and happily awaited our turn to go inside. 

Once inside we expected the warm and pleasant smell of fried deliciousness but not so much.  I won't go into the decor because I'm sure by know everyone has seen plenty of pictures and know what to expect inside at least visually. 

We ordered the little voodoo guy, a maple bacon donut and coffee...and the verdict is....drumroll please:

Coffee:  Holy willykers batman! It seriously tasted like they used the year old sock of an unbathed transient (which there happens to be plenty in the area) to filter the coffee.  It was bitter, acidic and talk about after taste...just putrid! 

Donuts:  Save your pennies and go to your local Krispy Kreme or anywhere else.  My little voodoo guy had no taste as far as the dough went.  The frosting I just about went into diabetic shock it was like taking a shot of sugar dressed with powdered sugar topped with brown sugar with a sprinkle of splenda.

DONUTS: We ordered the random dozen and chose another dozen. We got to sample everything from the traditional voodoo to maple cream filled to mango to Oreo. For eight people, two dozen is a LOT, but who doesn't love creative and fun donuts? The donuts come in such fun shapes, colors, and designs that it mixes play with food. I loved it. The one caveat that dinged it one star is the warmth of the donut. I love a warm freshly fried donut, but I understand that to meet the demand, the donuts can't be super warm. It's a tough place to be in for Voodoo.

I came here for the first time last year and tried their famous maple bacon bar and cock-and-balls donut. The maple bacon bar is like eating pancakes with a side a bacon. It sounds weird, but it tastes good. The cock-and-balls is just two chocolate bars perpendicular to each other with vanilla pudding in the ""balls"". They make great party favors for bachelorette parties and those crazy nights with the girls only.

On my second visit, I got the maple bacon bar and got another specialty, the Tex-ass. A huge glazed donut that is about the size of a regular dinner plate. It probably would go straight to your ass if you eat the entire thing by yourself. Fortunately, my friends helped me eat it.

What I find hysterical is that they offer wedding packages for their two locations, but they offer more options at their Davis Street location than at this location. I didn't see where people can get married, but I assumed it was upstairs since I saw a roped off staircase. If you don't want to get married, they do offer a commitment ceremony for $25.

They are not the best donuts I ever had, but I really enjoyed the novelty of them. If you don't wait in the long line during the day, head back here again at night. Hardly anyone in line.

I ordered the standard maple bar. I know that sounds ridiculous to order a regular donut that I can get at any donut shop but I wanted to compare apples to apples. Anyone can be fooled by bells and whistles. I needed to get down to brass tax. The maple bar was good, but I've probably had better at little hole in the wall donut shops with the white greasy bags. My bf had the maple bacon bar and exclaimed it was the best donut he's ever had. It looked good but I didn't have any. I appreciated that there were whole bacon strips on top.

This place is all about the weird flavors, naughty shaped, and crazy add ons, not necessarily the fact the actual donuts are high quality fluffs of sweet heavenly dough. 

Portand has to die for bakeries with award winning chefs and bakers so not sure the hype surrounding this place. I am sure it is just a fun tourist trap kind of place that every city has. Decor is cool though! And I am guessing it is fun to come in and get a phallic shaped donut especially if you are drunk after-hours. ( Voodoo is open 24 hours) 

I chose two donuts on my visit. On the first one I could not taste the donut itself because there was too much stuff and extra flavorings on it. It was also kind of stale/ hard. This was the, ""Dirty Bastard"" flavored donut. The verdict was that it was good but it was like a 5 year old's birthday cake, just too much going on. Sometimes less is more, ya know?

The amount of attention the donut industry has received within the last few years is amazing.  It's so mainstream now as everyone's go to dessert or to fulfill our sweet tooth or cravings for sweets, it brought Chel here. 

On my northwest vacation earlier this year,  I knew I was going to drop by here no matter what.   It was definitely in my bookmark.  Located in downtown Portland, street parking wasn't too bad midweek right before lunch hour.  A short walk led us to a short line that took about 20 mins to get inside the building. 

So wow.  The first thing that I noticed was that Huge donut artifact on top of the ceiling.   Very eclectic decor indeed from one wall to another,  then you have the several glass cases, rotating ones too, with displays of their unique donut creations.

What to get? Hhmmm...this and that but the bacon maple bar was definitely first on my list.  The oblong shape maple donut with two strips of bacon on top can make anyone drool just by looking at it as it did Chel.  Although   I'm not too much of a donut fan, that balanced taste of salt and sweet just screams, ""eat me, eat me Chel!"" So she did gracefully only to wash it down with a cup of Stumptown coffee (ty Ninong Joseph A. for reminding me). But I wish it was warm, and the maple still slightly wet, and the bacon freshly made and more crispy so when you bite into it the entire bacon doesn't come off the donut.  That's just my idea of an awesome,  honest to goodness, BOMB azz bacon maple donut!

Soft.  Tasty.  Teaser.   Unique.  Sweet.  Yup.

However, over a round of drinks in the hotel bar before bedtime, my colleagues informed me that I had missed a critical item on my Portland to-do list: a visit to the famous Voodoo Doughnut shop.  Being from New Orleans, I obviously have an affinity for voodoo dolls, and I'm actually familiar with this doughnut shop, both from the Food Network and from some Google searches for voodoo doll-themed desserts.  I had completely forgotten, however, that it was located in Portland - and only three minutes or so from my hotel!  So, I stopped by the front desk before heading upstairs and changed my cab from 6:30am to 6:15am so I could pop by and grab a doughnut before my flight.

In the morning, the very nice cab driver agreed to make a pit-stop at Voodoo Doughnut.  I had looked at its menu the night before and decided what I wanted - however, when I learned that their ""cream"" filling is actually Bavarian creme and not the whipped, sugary ""Kreme"" one finds inside a Krispy Kreme doughnut, I changed my order a bit.  However, I still ended up with a whopping five doughnuts (this behavior will not bode well for me in a few years).  For $10.80 (cash only, but thankfully they have an ATM), I walked away with a lovely pink box full of the following doughnuts:

(1) Dubble Bubble - This was my ""fun,"" ""funky"" purchase, but it ended up being my second favorite doughnut.  It's a soft, fluffy yeast doughnut topped with vanilla icing and bubble gum dust, making it a lovely pink shade.  The dust on top gives it a strange but only slight - and actually quite enjoyable - chewiness.  It even comes with a piece of bubble gum!  Very cute and very creative - and very tasty in that nice, old-fashioned bubble gum way (it does not have the artificial bubble gum taste of children's toothpaste).

(2) Old Dirty Bastard - This doughnut was extremely delicious, but very heavy.  It is another delightful yeast doughnut topped with chocolate icing, Oreo cookies, and peanut butter drizzle - and it's truly a dessert.  It should be banned before noon.  Except it's too good to pass up!

(3) Memphis Mafia - I've read rave reviews on this one, but I really disliked it.  The cake doughnut was too heavy and the glaze too saccharin to be combined with cinnamon sugar, chocolate sauce (not chocolate icing; it was much harder and had an odd flavor), chocolate chips, bananas, and peanut butter.  I only took two bites.

(4) Captain my Captain - I love Captain Crunch cereal, but having crunchy carbs on top of soft yeast doughnut carbs was a little much.  Too many carbs, too many different textures, and too much sweetness from the vanilla icing overpowering the salty-sweet flavor of the cereal.

(5) Voodoo Doll - Saving the best for last!  I love the concept, design, and flavors.  Their chocolate icing is great and less sweet than the vanilla.  However, I didn't get an authentic experience, as my doughnut somehow wound up with cream in the center instead of jelly.  Kind of a bummer, but I will say, the cream was far better than I could have hoped.

Overall, this was a great experience - high quality, fresh doughnuts with inventive toppings and amusing names, all at reasonable prices.

Hadn't even heard of Screen Door until searching for a place for Sunday brunch and saw the huge number of reviews. When my girlfriend and I got there, the line was, um, substantial. Table for 2 = 90 minute wait.  Typically, I would probably start looking for backup plans, but I had a good feeling about this place.  We killed time down the block at Heart coffee roasters and came back after about 45 minutes, thinking that maybe they overestimated.  No such luck as we waited in the drizzly rain.  Thankfully through the natural course of attrition, our name was finally called and we got a seat at the counter.

First order of the day: Bloody Mary's, and these didn't disappoint...except that they weren't as spicy to our liking.  So added some of their house made hot sauce, and that helped considerably.  After studied perusal of the menu, and observing the plates leaving the kitchen, my GF determined the fried chicken and waffle was the obvious choice.  I opted for the shrimp with bacon and cheddar grits with over-medium eggs.  While waiting (not so patiently), the sheer number of chicken and waffle plates emerging from the kitchen was mind boggling.  Clearly this was the star of the show here.  And once our order arrived, it was easy to see why.  Perfectly fried chicken, juicy and flavorful, especially for all white meat.   The light and fluggy Belgain-style waffle was spiced with clove, nutmeg and all-spice and provided a nice counterpoint to the chicken.  Alternating between sweet maple syrup and the house hot sauce made for deliciousness, bite after bite.

My shrimp and grits dish was no slouch.  Creamy cheddar grits and perfect cooked shrimp with bacon is a classic combination, and one very well executed here.  The nicely cooked eggs lent a nice runny yolk which added to the richness of the grits.  Served with a great biscuit alongside, this was a deeply satisfying plate of food.

Thoroughly stuffed, we rolled out of the Screen Door immensely happy and looking forward to the next time we were in Portland for another visit.",dR9OiTIjuzvDdoqjuulKrw,2337 E Burnside St,"Caterers, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern, Event Planning & Services, Bakeries, Cajun/Creole, Food",Portland,45.5230858,-122.64168000000001,Screen Door,97214,7219,4.5,OR,1

But I'm not going to write about their food. Why? Well, read the rest of 700 reviews.

So in order to pitch in this conversation, I'm going to write about something that might save you time when you go here.

I arrived here at 4:55 in order to save seats for my family (3 adults, 2 children, 2 infants). The guy told me it was going to be at least an hour wait. Ok. That's reasonable. I waited and waited. After an hour, the guy comes back and ensures me that I'll get seated within 20 to 30 minutes. Fine. I can wait. Around 6, four people came in and wrote their names on the list. Within 15 mins I was seated with my family; and at the same time the party of 4 was seated ALONG with another party of 5. 

SOOO.

Go here around 6:30ish and you can find seats quickly. FYI, I went here on a Saturday.

I'm giving them 4 stars not for the wait but for the service. The waitress (I think she was very stressed out or something) was very pushy and passive-aggressive.

We passed by to see the line rounding the block and decided that our hunger wouldn't hold out any longer so passed.

But later in the day, we decided that we were within the time when they opened up for dinner. When we got there... which was about 30 mins from opening there was probably 5 people in line from the door. We decided we wanted some AC so we killed some time at a pet store down the street for literally 15 mins - and when we got back, the line was wrapped around the building with about 20 more people in line -_-

We weren't sure if we were going to get a table during the first round of people but we were SUPER lucky and nabbed one of the last tables. The host asked if we were okay with the table by the kitchen - just in case we didn't like it. We weren't picky and at this point were just happy to get a table so we happily went what we dubbed the ""Chef's Table"" - it was actually pretty cool. Not sure why people wouldn't want this table.

I wasn't too hungry so I decided to just stick with a Starter - Fried Okra which was buttermilk battered and deep fried okra wheels served with homemade remoulade. It looked yummy but I wasn't a fan.
It tasted really slimy. Almost like gross slimy. I don't know. For a lack of a better term it tasted like a loogie. LOL. I know, I know. WTH Camille?! I know. But that's what best describes it. Sorry!

My friend and I got there at the worst possible time, 10 am on a Sunday morning. Perhaps fifteen people were in front of us in line, so we got coffee and prepared to stand outside in the rain for awhile. Lo, we were seated within 20 minutes. 

Service is fast and efficient without being untidy or unfriendly. Our cheerful waitress filled my water and coffee were filled whenever it went past the halfway point. The fried chicken was better than Pine State's, and when you order the chicken and waffles there's a HUGE pile of it, about ten inches tall! I stuffed my face and still had half a waffle and basically two chicken breasts to take home with me!

The wait was a bit longer this time - even at 9:30am on a Friday morning, there was a line out the door and a 30 minute wait. It is worth it though! 

This time, we shared the following:
Praline bacon waffle ($9.50): this was as delicious as it was the first time. The waffle is light and fluffy, and is covered in ample whipped cream and maple syrup. The chopped pralines added a delicious crunch and sweetness, and the thick-cut slice of bacon covered in chopped pralines and caramelized in brown sugar was pure crunchy, salty, umami perfection. The best waffle I have had in my life!
Bananas foster French toast ($8.25): this was delicious as well, although not as much of a standout as the bacon praline waffle. There were two large thick-cut brioche slices that had been soaked in vanilla custard and grilled to golden brown perfection. They were accompanied by ample whipped cream (my favorite!) and rum-flamed bananas and topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar and maple syrup.

My friend from Portland took us out to eat brunch here during the weekend, and the anticipation of eating here was psyching me out a bit.

This is one of those places that can probably be compared to Bills Cafe in SJ (which I still haven't had the luxury of eating at yet).  I'll have to see how Bills rates next to Screen Door soon.  Anyhow, the wait was pretty long but easy when you have three other friends to talk to.  The place had an outdoor patio eating area and was essentially packed.  

They had some pretty good free coffee inside for all patrons waiting (both decaf and regular I believe).  The interior was nicely trendy and slightly modern from what I can remember.  I was pretty decisive on ordering the fried oyster benedict and damn the portion was big.  I couldn't finish the whole thing, and had to box up like a third of it. The other food ordered looked f-ing delish which I had pictures of.  I don't usually take pics of food before eating but should think about carrying a point and shoot for that more often.  I remember seeing a guy next to us pull out a full sized Samsung Galaxy Tab, first time seeing someone use that in a restaurant... hehe.

I've tried about everything on the menu and everything here is amazing! Big portions, big flavor! The one item that stand out the most to me though is the praline maple bacon!

The thick cut bacon is and the maple syrup definitely makes you want to just keep eating and eating.

It is always amazing. Warm, welcoming, and very accommodating. If you have a big party larger than 6 or 7 you can call in ahead to put your group on the waitlist. They do not do reservations but this is better than nothing. All the servers are very attentive and make sure your experience and well spent.

We arrived about 5 or 10 minutes before they opened and we were a bit surprised by the length of the line. We just missed the cut off for a table inside but waited the 20 or 30 minutes to get seated outside on the patio. As we had our young daughter the patio was the ideal spot anyway. I really enjoyed having a cup of coffee as we waited, glad they allow customers to help themselves. 

We started with a Bloody Mary. While we are not big drinkers we both enjoy a good Bloody Mary from time to time. And as it was a holiday we indulged. Nice spice, not overly strong with a delicious pickled okra garnish. Next came the rhubarb turnovers, a nice treat to whet our appetites. The filling was well prepared with a touch of tartness. They vanished as fast as they arrived. 

My wife ordered the bananas foster french toast, simple but oh so good. Love the hint of orange, the soft but not mushy bread and the fact that the plate could have fed us all. After having look at the menu a few weeks back I had expected I would order a scramble. However, when we were waiting to be seated I spied plate after plate of chicken and waffles. Never having had to combination it seemed this would be the ideal circumstance to give it a try. And I was not disappointed one bit. The bird was crispy with a nice peppery finish, a prefect compliment to the bloody as well as the waffle. The sweet potato did not stand out but the waffle was still great. I have seen the light, we will be back for more!

Farm Grits: warm and savory cheesy grits with poached eggs on top. I found the extra giant piece of ham in the plate a bit distracting. I think if it was a thicker ham chopped into smaller pieces would be easier to eat. I think the big piece of ham is a bit too much for the dish. 3/5

I had the Mac n cheese of course, the catfish (add an extra dollar), and the German potato salad. My bf got the fried chicken and my bro got the brisket.  

The Mac and cheese unfortunately did not deliver for me, only because I'm spoiled by Homeroom in Oakland, CA, which specializes in Mac and cheese entrees and is very good at it.  Screen Door's take on the Mac and cheese was a little bland and runny for me. I did like the top--a layer of baked cheesy goodness.

The beef brisket was good until we found a hair in it. They replaced the plate very quickly....

Our first attempt to try this spot was at opening on Sunday morning. We arrived 10 minutes before opening to find the line was down the street already. I didn't want to make our friends wait for hours so I moved brunch to the Hunnymilk pop up (it was amazing too!). The second attempt was mid-morning on Monday and the line was shorter. We ended up waiting an hour and a half for breakfast. The restaurant has a bar behind the hostess stand where you can grab coffee, juice, and drinks to enjoy while you wait. I'd suggest this since your wait will most likely be a long one.

At long last we were seated at one of the picnic tables on the patio. I liked the outdoor seating and the patio was definitely less lively than the inside of the restaurant. By the time we were seated we had decided on our brunch feast options so we got to it.

I had the Pimento Cheese & Sausage Biscuit Sandwich. Ahhhhhmazing. The biscuit was piled high and was a fork and knife sandwich. The biscuit was very tasty, the sausage patty was thick, eggs perfectly prepared, and the pimento cheese was delicious. The ingredients sound standard, but the taste was far from standard. The Cheesy Grits on the side were yummy as well.

My husband had the Fried Oyster Breakfast Po-Boy. This is not a dainty sandwich, bring your appetite. He absolutely loved this and was happy to get his fried oyster fix in Portland. The roasted potatoes on the side were amazing.

For breakfast dessert we shared the Coconut Pancakes with Rhubarb Compote and orange whipped cream. The pancakes were fluffy and the coconut flavor was very nice. The orange whipped cream was really good and a nice touch. I loved the rhubarb compote on top and could have enjoyed at least twice as much.

I won't argue...) or the seasonal specials list (if there's any manner of savory bread pudding on there, and there usually is, don't even think, just get it). 

Breakfast, though, is where they shine brightest, and be warned: they have the line to prove it. But if anyplace is worth waiting for, this is it.

It definitely set the vibe as Southern style. We jumped into the hot drinks quickly, hot coffee and hot chocolate. Unfortunately, I didn't like either of them.

Gravy excellent flavor with country style. It is very thick, which means it's authentic with lots of corn starch, fat, or butter some sort. The fried chicken was great!!! Excellent crispy breading outside, nice heavy flavor, and juicy and tender inside. To my memory, I can take a little bit stronger flavor. The grits was great!

They ever so graciously comped one of her beers.  ONE BEER!  Couldn't they have at least comped her meal?  Given her a free dessert?  Those were my complaints.

As far as the food goes, it was good, but didn't live up to the hype for me.  I think maybe the wait took away from it and the mess up.

Today was my mother's birthday.  THIS IS HOW WE CELEBRATED her 73rd year old life - eating food that you could die on and know that it was THE BEST meal you have ever had!!!  And not having 2 restless & demanding children with us!!!

We got to the restaurant early (1 hour before opening) and there were already 18 people in front of us at 4:35 PM.   We were seated at 5:35PM and there were 70+ people behind us!!!  By the time we had eaten and were leaving, there were still 30+ people waiting to be seated.

WE ordered the pork belly appetizer:  Slow roasted pork belly with a candied rhubarb glaze topped with frisee, asparagus and torn herbs.  The flavors were so delicious and completely complimented each other!  The pork was SO tender, you could cut it with your fork and it melted in your mouth!!!

PORK BELLY is THE PORN STAR of pork products...  It makes you feel giddy, dirty and guilty all at the same time!!!  And yet, you just can't help yourself!!!???!!!

My mom had the fried chicken, mashed potatoes and collard greens.  This was the best fried chicken - EVER!  Completely deboned, pounded and fried to crispy perfection.
I consumed most of the collard greens and I must saw  - YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

I ordered the beef brisket platter.  It came with BBQ sauce, Cole slaw and baked beans.  I was only able to eat 1 (out of 4) slabs of brisket...The Cole slaw was super creamy and delicious and the beans were sweet & spicy good!!!

My mom & I both ordered dessert:  1 Creole Pecan Pie and 1 Lemon Layer Cake with homemade buttermilk ice cream.   BOTH WERE OUTSTANDING in portion size, flavor and presentation!!!

I have read previous reviews of persons saying the portions sizes were too small...SERIOUSLY?? You must either have had too much to drink - or-  you are person who consumes too much on a regular basis!!!???!!!

My fiance and I agreed we haven't had any good ones since Roscoe's in Los Angeles, and Screen Door definitely beats Roscoe's. Skillet in Seattle is not bad, but I love when the waffles is just crispy at the edges and the inside is soft. If we weren't having a food crawl around Portland, we may have just ate our fill of chicken and waffles. 

The chicken was well seasoned, crispy on the outside and juice and tender on the inside. It comes out piping hot almost like it's just finishing in the box as it comes out. I wish I knew what seasoning they used because it was that good. I'm craving more just from writing about it. The waffles does come with maple syrup, but it's fluffy enough that no toppings are needed. We also ordered cornbread, but it didn't add much to the dish. It was dense, dry, and was not to my liking since I don't enjoy corn chunks in my cornbread.

If you want strategy and my opinions, keep on, and I'll give some advice as I see it. 

Wait times are long so consider going with a party of 2 or have a wait plan with your big group. 

Some more detailed options:
Brunch
1. Go early (8:30am to wait in line for 9am open) for weekend brunch. 
2. Just suck it up and wait in line. This may mean 1 hour or more. (Plan for it. Go to a nearby bar for a drink. Or bring a book. Chat with your friends.)

Dinner
3. Go for dinner late night. I have been seated late on weeknights without waiting.
4. Go for dinner at opening. You'll have to arrive early to make sure you are in the first seating.
5. Go whenever and just plan to wait.

Seasonal/special fresh veggies are always delish!

My boyfriend ordered the fried oyster breakfast POBOY which he said was reallllly good, I didn't taste it but it looked really good! with the sammich he had a bloody mary.

Oh and we HAD to order the Praline Bacon which my boyfriend LOVED, he was trying to figure how they made it and wanted to try and make it at home.

Just accept the wait. Don't go if you can't wait, both for a table, service, and the food. Nothing is speedy at this restaurant. Also know that whatever time estimate they give you when your put your name down is likely to be underestimating the actual wait. When we go to Tasty N Alder and they tell us an hour and a half wait, we know it will probably be 45 minutes. When Screen Door says an hour and a half, we know it's more likely to be 2 hours. 

We've been twice for dinner so far -- once at 8:00pm on a Saturday night and we waited until 9:45pm until we were seated. Service and food was fairly prompt. We also went at 7pm on a Wednesday night. Wait was 25 minutes and the place wasn't very busy, but service was incredibly slow. After our order was dropped off, we only saw our server once more before we asked for the bill. We waited for our water to be refilled. When I asked for to go containers, he brought me 4 containers but only 3 lids. I needed 5 containers and 5 lids. He didn't bring me a bag. I asked 1) for the containers, 2) for an extra lid and an extra set of container + lids, and 3) for the bag. The last time, I got up and went over to the service area because I didn't want to wait 10 minutes for our server to meander back to our table and I got chastised a little for getting up. I don't know why he thought I'd want to carry 5 containers to my car without a bag to put them in. 

I'm trying to remember why I'm giving this place five stars. 

OH RIGHT, the food. Both the fried chicken and the chicken tenders are so freaking good. Juicy, lightly battered, well seasoned. Hot sauce on the table. I like the Screen Door plate which I get with mac and cheese (even good reheated), chicken tenders, and greens. With this, I get leftovers for another couple of meals. I also like the shrimp and grits, which are creamy and well seasoned.

The portions are huge, and the food is beyond delicious. You could seriously just close your eyes and point at anything on the menu, and be more than satisfied with your meal.

I have had the biscuits & gravy (sausage gravy, that is), and the banana foster french toast. Let me just say, I want to do terrible, terrible things to the biscuits and gravy. Just dirty, nasty things. And the banana foster french toast...I would like to take it out to an expensive meal, softly caress it's face and tell it how much it means to me. Really make sure it knows I don't know where I would be if it weren't in my life.

My boyfriend has had the famous fried chicken & waffles, and the po boy breakfast sandwich. Now, I'm not sure if you've heard already, but you get FOUR huge, fried chicken breasts stabbed through the waffle with a steak knife. Holy hell. I would highly recommend eating that with a buddy....unless your main goal in life is to clog your arteries. then go for it. The po boy is...it's...it's just sooooo goooood!!!! It's messy as hell to eat, but who freakin cares, it's deelish.

Other highlights: Breakfast Corndog, Praline Bacon, along with the Raspberry & Ricotta Blintz.

My only drawback, is the wait. They don't take reservations, and if you show up after 9:30, even if it's just for two people, you're going to be waiting at least a half hour, most likely closer to a full hour. However, if you can make it through that wait, you will be HANDSOMELY rewarded.

Screen Door is one of the most reviewed places in Portland. As per recommendations from several of my friends who have been to Portland before, the Screen Door's fried chicken is something not to be missed.

My friends and I came to the Screen Door at around 8pm. We waited around 30 minutes for a table for 4. When we came in, we decided to sit outside since the weather was still nice!

My friend and I split one dish, we got the Crispy Fried Buttermilk-battered chicken, which comes with fried breast and thigh with Tasso ham gravy, mashed potatoes and we chose collard greens as our side.

The food took awhile to come out, but since they make their fried chicken to order, it might have taken some time to get the dishes ready. While some might think it's crazy to split one dish, the portion size of the chicken at the Screen Door is insane. 

In my opinion the chicken was just alright. I thought the taste and texture of the breading was definitely good, but the chicken itself wasn't great. It was also strange to me that both the thigh and breast piece tasted exactly the same. I personally think frying with the bone gives the chicken a lot more flavor, and to me it made sense to why I've had better buttermilk-battered chicken elsewhere.
The mashed potatoes and gravy were just a classic, nothing special, but definitely good.
The collard greens however were very good. I really liked the amount of acidity in the greens, it really built my appetite and made me want to eat more of the dish.

Overall, this isn't the best fried chicken I've ever had, but definitely the dish overall was great, and the value of the meal is fairly decent as well.",64M69FJCE9Hanm_7ci7G3w,2337 E Burnside St,"Caterers, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern, Event Planning & Services, Bakeries, Cajun/Creole, Food",Portland,45.5230858,-122.64168000000001,Screen Door,97214,7219,4.5,OR,1

The sauce was the right amount of spice and sweetness, rather than other places where it's too overpowering. The onion strings were nice and crispy, so they didn't feel like they had been cooked and left out. The side dish was some kind of greens with bacon in it.

I'm a sucker for pulled pork sandwiches and the screen doors did not disappoint. the barbecue sauce on the sandwich? not a sauce, but a jus. it soaked the meat and the bottom of the burger in a decadent, rich, smoky juice. like nothing I've ever tasted. it was heaven. and just when I thought my life at the screen door could not get s lick better the mac and cheese arrived. creamy, gooey, crispy, with what I would a call a crispy baked cheese tortilla all over the top.

YES.

Two words: fried chicken.

Three more words: fried pork chops. 

Many more words: mac 'n cheese, fried oysters, fried catfish, pork shoulder

This is place is the real deal. The fried chicken was some of the juiciest fried chicken I have ever had... and it's white meat! Breast meat. Two large, juicy, fried breasts, from what must have been a very busty chicken.

Their Hot Chocolate, best ever too. I'm going to go ahead and say, everything you order here will be amazing. A place that truly thinks about their guests. The staff is great, but under high pressure when it's busy, so it can take time when they are slammed.

She told me I could not use that chair because they get very packed, and also that I could not block the isle. 

I kindly replied, informing her that I do not set my handbags on the ground and asked to be seated somewhere else with more room. She left to go and speak to her manager who had her pull another table and chair to turn our seating into a table for four which was nice of management to do, considering we were already seated with drinks. But I could tell the waitress felt slighted. I told my boyfriend to look at two other tables, which had been placed together for larger parties, which were blocking the isles too... I just thought she was creating a scene that wasn't needed. I remained polite nonetheless, but she seemed frustrated by the outcome. 

As for the food, NO!!!! I ordered their wings, which were over seasoned with black pepper and the flour coating was not good to me at all. The gumbo tasted like paste, it was disgusting also.

My friend who came before recommended that I come 30 min before they opened so the wait wouldn't be as long and I definitely would recommend the same to anyone else. Their dinner and brunch menu change so we unfortunately were not able to try their sweet potato waffles/other brunch items. On Yelp, it said that they do not take reservations but they do if the party is 6 or more. 

We ordered their fried chicken, hush puppies, and corn bread. The fried chicken was my favorite! I loved how it moist and juicy, although it did get too salty after a few bites. The hush puppies were delicious as well but what was disappointing was that it tasted EXACTLY like the corn bread, except fried instead of baked. It seemed like they took the ""lazy way out"" when it came to their hush puppy recipe. The corn bread was the least favorite because it was on the drier and more salty side, and I prefer my cornbread moist and sweet.

Good restaurant but probably would not come again because the wait can be a hassle. Don't really recommend the corn bread.

I am usually not a big fan of this cuisine, neither do I ever have the balls to try it. So, with that being said, I was pretty fast to judge the Southern cuisine as something I would never try.

I wish I had taken that back. 

This restaurant is located in the midst of a very quiet neighborhood, but the hustling and bustling of the place is quite amusing, especially on a Saturday night. Upon arrival, the place was obviously packed. People were waiting inside, people were waiting outside, people were waiting near the bar, people were desperately, patiently waiting to taste what the restaurant has to offer. My wait time for 2 people was estimated about 45 mins, but I'd say that I waited no more than half an hour.

Was the wait worth it? Not exactly.

The boyfriend and I shared the cripsy buttermilk fried chicken and the special of the night, which was the shrimp in New Orleans Sauce. Fat overload. I am pretty sure I'd gained 5 pounds after that dinner.

The fried chicken was good, however the sauce may be too peppery for my liking. It was deep fried (d-uh) with crispy layer of skin and the juicy chicken breast reveals itself. I did not finish my portion of the chicken. I, however, did love the mashed potatoes that was included. So soft and creamy.................

The shrimps were alright. I think we were too hungry, to the point that we devoured everything in 5. It was very buttery and loaded with a layer of oil. Bread was included for dipping into the sauce.

Overall, I feel that this place is rather overhyped.

Especially yummy, delicious food. We arrived around 8:40am on Sunday in hopes of making the 9:00am opening and first seating. They seat slowly to give the staff time to absorb the influx of diners -- the good news is that our party of 5 was seated on the patio (has heaters) and it was game on for their weekend brunch.

Our waitress was friendly and on the spot with water, coffee and refills. The menu has SO MANY wonderful sounding dishes that we agreed to come back soon so we can eat our way through the menu.  Our group had the:

Pimiento Cheese & Sausage Biscuit Sandwich
freshly baked buttermilk biscuit layered w/ pimiento cheese, house breakfast pork sausage & over easy fried egg w/ your choice of grits, cheddar grits or roasted potatoes.

Huevos Rancheros
Roja braised natural beef brisket layered w/ crispy corn tortillas, pepper-jack cheese, two over medium eggs* & slow cooked black beans, cilantro crema & sauce ranchera.

Broccoli & Fennel Sausage Frittata
Broccoli, fennel sausage, onions, arugula salad with lemon vinaigrette and oven roasted potatoes

Grits Bowl with Cremini Mushrooms and Cheddar Cheddar Cheese

First the coffee is good (it better be. it's 2017 and this is Portland, Oregon.) Portions are large. You could consider sharing -- or take it home for later! I did.

The sauces on the Huervos Rancheros are savory, unexpected and complex. This dish has layers of flavor and is a must-try.

The frittata was the perfect blend of eggs veggies a touch of cheese. The salad with lemon on top made this a meal to enjoy before walking/exploring or tackling the day.

The grits bowl was rich and delicious.

The biscuit was large and the type you eat with a fork and knife. Rave reviews on the pimiento cheese and the biscuit.

Nit: Patio seating in mid-March on a cold morning.... brrrrr. The patio is lovely and the heaters were helpful but there is an inch of space between the bottom of the tarp-side walls and the ground. Brrr. Thank goodness for hot coffee, great company, good conversation and outstanding food.

We were seated at 6:30 and started with some Hurricanes (which are some of the best I've had). Shared a few appetizers including the friend okra, crab cakes (special that night) and the shrimp and grits. The friend okra was done just right with big chunks of okra lightly battered and served with their remoulade sauce. The shrimp and grits were probably the table favorite. Perfectly creamy grits with a bacon, tomato, garlic and white wine sauce...incredibly good. The crab cakes were also very light and tasty. We all shared a few dinners including the friend chicken, pecan crusted trout, chicken strips and beef brisket. The portions are huge and we just about managed to finish everything. Ended the dinner with their banoffee pie. Wow!

As many have mentioned, arrive EARLY.  My father and I arrived at 8:40AM, 20 minutes before they opened and we were about #15 in line, of about 45 (and it was pouring down rain).  As we were eagerly awaiting the front doors to open, I realized that this place must be good as the line continued to grow and the rain continued to fall.

Once we were inside, we were promptly seated and served coffee and water.  With so many wonderfully tasting options, my dad and I did more of a family style when we ordered, so we could try more than one item.  I ordered the fried chicken and sweet potato waffle and he ordered the 'big breakfast' with 2 over easy eggs, potatoes, apple pork sausage, and substituted the toast for a biscuit.  We also ordered a side of the praline bacon.  

First, I tend to lean towards sausage over bacon, and wow, the praline bacon was some of the best bacon I have ever eaten in my life.  The combination of sweet and salty is perfect.  The bacon is also a bit thicker cut than normal and moist.  

Secondly, you must try the fried chicken, amazing!  Very crisp and flavorful on the outside and moist and chewy in the inside.  Add a piece of the sweet potato waffle and fresh maple syrup and you realize why you waited in the rain for breakfast.  

Thirdly, for your typical, eggs, some sort of meat, potatoes, and toast, the 'big breakfast' definitely will exceed your expectations.  The apple sausage links (2) were quite flavorful, the red potatoes were seasoned perfectly, and the eggs were just like my dad likes them.  I would say the only downfall of our entire meal was the biscuit.  It was a tad fluffy, cake-like for my liking.  It was like a biscuit angel food cake in the way it was prepared as far as looks and how it tasted (yet obviously not sweet like angel food cake).  I like my biscuit more flaky and creamy.

Our service was fabulous, as our water and coffee glasses were never empty.  The coffee beans are from Stumptown and did not disappoint.  

If you wake up on a Saturday or Sunday morning wanting a delicious breakfast that you will continue to talk about the entire day and keep you full for a while (as the portions are quite large, you will most likely have left overs) try Screen Door, it won't disappoint.",HmqrZgm99Jw1gYQkudeq7g,2337 E Burnside St,"Caterers, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern, Event Planning & Services, Bakeries, Cajun/Creole, Food",Portland,45.5230858,-122.64168000000001,Screen Door,97214,7219,4.5,OR,1

The catfish was also incredible - not fishy at all, and the breading was perfect.  The red beans and rice was delicious, as were the hush puppies to start.

I've had the oyster benny It tasted like it should but one of my eggs was a wee bit over poached nothing that would ruin it though.

Had the brisket hash special and I LOVED the flavor only thing I didn't like though was that the brisket was cut in a way that left chunks of fat mixed in with the meat and potatoes.  The fat chunks also resembled potatoes so I would occasionally get a bit of just beef fat.

breakfast corndog is awesome definitely something i loved.

Everyone on Yelp recommended the chicken and waffles, but since the portions were so huge and we wanted to try more items, we opted out this time. (Actually, all of their items have huge portions. But the chicken and waffles dish is bigger than my head!)

Sitting at the bar, we witnessed the bartender making Bloody Marys after Bloody Marys. They looked delicious! 

- Farm Grits: cheddar grits with ham, poached eggs, and provolone. This dish is super cheesey! 
- Biscuits and Gravy: warm and flavorful.. perfect comfort food.
- Chicken Strips: so juicy! If the chicken used for the chicken and waffles is as good as the strips, it's no wonder the chicken and waffles dish is so famous.

I heard a lot about the chicken and waffles so I decided to try it but I must have missed where they said it feeds a party of at least 2-3 people. It's a normal size large waffle but 3 large chicken breast on top. It's ridiculously big so either share or plan on taking the rest home. Waffle is delicious, chicken is tender and has a small kick which I liked. I also had to try the Burnside Brandy Milk Punch since I do love Brandy Milk Tea, and it was very good. Definitely more Brandy than the milk tea version. Lastly the orange juice is good, fresh squeezed off site, not there, but still fresh squeezed. A small is enough to complete my meal because a large is a pint sized glass, which everywhere else is unheard of! I would have gotten the large is I was already so full.

The situation:
*I arrived after other guests were seated and without hesitation, a chair, menu, silverware and water were brought for me so I could immediately enjoy my party.
*Our food took a little while and our waiter brought us fruit to nibble on with apologies.
*The response to condiment needs were handled in a fast, friendly way.
*Our food was great, coffee always topped off, drinks came fast and our bill wasn't rushed.
Service A+++++++++++++++++ some of the best I've experienced in the 7 years I've lived in Portland. Truly miraculous. Especially on a beautiful Sunday morning and you know the house was packed.
Atmosphere A+++ (but not as many). It was cute, clean, but mostly just full of tables that has something of a cafeteria feel that I don't love. Their pickled fruits and vegetables on display were a really nice touch, but the interior design isn't...quite as good as the service, let's say.
Food A+++ (same rating as atmosphere). The portions are unappetizing. Grown men cannot finish their food. There's a lot of waste, take home containers, etc., which from a food industry standpoint, I do not like. I judiciously ordered 1 biscuit and sausage gravy and thought there could have been more sausage, but the flavor and texture of both the gravy and the biscuit were very good and made a good match, but wasn't the most flavorful of all time. I was stuffed after half a biscuit. Seriously. The 1 biscuit/gravy, a cup of coffee and a small mimosa with tip was $20, which I thought was reasonable. The chicken and waffles, while good, could be half the size and no one is going to leave hungry. it would still be impressive. It's just.too.much.food. I think the bananas foster french toast was good, but way too sweet. As in, it could put someone into a diabetic coma. The omelettes were very pretty and looked good.

All in all, I don't really think my experience justifies the insane wait, when there are perfectly great brunch options in the immediate vicinity (notably, East Burn) but I was grateful for the impeccable service and the food was served hot.

Ah. Sweet satisfaction. The trick to getting seated immediately appears to be to show up in the last 30 minutes of a Sunday night -- thanks, folks, for feeding us!

Fiending for their juicy, crisp, spicy, savory fried chicken, but didn't want to leave feeling like a beached marine mammal -- the perfect solution, of course, was to split one fried chicken plate and one Screen Door plate: three local/organic dishes plus cornbread. I chose the celery root and parsnip gratin with andouille bread crumbs, the roasted beet salad (with arugula, avocado, pistachios, grapefruit, and citrus vinaigrette), and the concord pear salad (with black mission figs plumped in balsamic vinegar and honey, frisee, endive, watercress, toasted almonds & manchego cheese in a cider vinaigrette). Delicious! And aren't you proud of me for choosing such healthy options? The chicken, of course, was perfect. Mashed potatoes, savory porky collard greens, crumbly moist sweet corn bread -- perfect. The hubby almost didn't share -- I distinctly heard a growl from his side of the table when I reached for my half. The hubby even went for the peanut butter pie (after making lame reference to current Salmonella peanut butter epidemic), which was a tad rich for me, but very very tasty.

The cocktails were lovely. I had the Rhett Butler, which had perfect Southern Gentleman manners (with a hint of roguish bourbon charm). The hubby didn't share his.

Service: impeccable, as always. Friendly and personable, but not cloying; fast and efficient, with great suggestions at the right moments. Some of the least stress-prone servers in Portland.

It was delicious the cheese grits were creamy & the shrimp w/ lardon was amazing the sauce complimented it and brought it all together!!! Also the Chicken & sweet potato waffle i was pleasantly surprised at the moisture & taste of the boneless fried chicken. And the waffle! Wow you definitely have to request the La. Cane syrup to get the real southern taste that was meant to be.. And of course we could not pass up the Screendoor praline bacon, this my friends is the TRUTH! its rare we find southern comfort food were EVERYTHING is so right, being a southern girl (Ga) my friend normally leaves missing home for lack of authenticity, however this trip she left missing home because the food touched her tastebuds in all the places her momma used to with her home cooking.

Having spent four years in LA, I immediately recalled memories of the original thing from Roscoe's Chick'n n Waffles...sounds strange, but amazingly yummy.

This place isn't Roscoe's, but it is darn good.  They give you three HUGE pieces of fried white meat chicken strips on an enormous sweet potato belgian waffle.  The whole thing is dusted with powdered sugar and held together by a knife plunged through those honking huge pieces of chicken on top of the waffle.  

It takes some maneuvering to assemble the dish properly  As my sister and I have discovered through many trips to Roscoe's, you have to pour the syrup onto the waffle, then lay the chicken on top of the waffle, then pour gravy (which you have to order on the side) over the chicken.  Then dig in!  (oh, very importantly, chicken and waffle go in your mouth at the same time)

Their chicken here is great...they might be lacking the juicy dark meat chicken that you can order at Roscoe's, but it is fried perfectly, not at all greasy, plus they make their batter a little spicy so it's got this incredible kick to it.  I was only able to finish a piece and a half of it before my stomach protested.

They had a special of ham and asiago biscuits that morning (deee-lish!!) which were absolute perfection, not too greasy, but flaky and flavorful.  They didn't require any butter or anything else.

Their coffee is bottomless.  Their eggs fluffy.  Their potatoes are big and chunky slices but roasted and crispy on the outside.  How can this not be the perfect brunch place?  Be prepared for a wait however since it seems that others have also realized this fact as well!!

Overall, this place gets a solid four and a half stars.

After a long, tiring drive down from Seattle, our first stop was at the Screen Door for dinner. A bit of a wait at 6pm - about 40 minutes or so, but to be expected for such a popular place.

We started out with the hush puppies and fried green tomatoes. The hush puppies were light and flavorful, and the tomatoes were very good and something we had always wanted to try.

For our mains, my husband ordered the beef brisket with 2 vegetable sides. He enjoyed the brisket, but didn't find it to be specatular and noted that the veggies were just ""ok."" I had the Screen Door Plate with a thin, crispy pork chop, grits, mac & cheese and cornbread. Cholestrol city! The pork chop was perfectly cooked although underseasoned. Loved the mac & cheese and grits. Just what I would expect - yum!

I really debated between 3-4 stars but after much discussion and thought, had to go with three stars for the following ""misses."" The heavily touted cornbread was dry. Really, really dry. Same for the humongous slice of red velvet cake. Sahara desert dry, and unfortunately, quite tasteless to boot! We managed a few bites with lots of vanilla ice cream but then just gave up.

The place is pretty big and busy so there is a wait, but things do keep moving. I had a good view of the kitchen from my seat and everything looked so amazing, fresh, and quality coming out of the kitchen.

The most amazing thing anyone at our table got was the fried chicken and waffle. 

The fried chicken alone is awesome. They do something great to the batter and it's a little spicy and the chicken is perfectly cooked. 

They present it with three pieces piled on a sweet potato waffle with a knife stuck through the top, through all the pieces, and into the waffle. It's served with maple syrup and is a big portion.

Fucking yum.

One thing I'm deducting a star for is the biscuits. I am a biscuit kind of girl and was really disappointed.

I ended up waiting for about an hour for a table but it worth the wait. I went traditional brunch style and had their Bloody Mary which came with an olive and pickled okra. It had nice flavor and rimmed with cayenne salt which gave it a nice kick. 

We started off with their strawberry blitz that was filled with ricotta and mascarpone cheese. It was tasty and a lot of the sweetness came from the strawberries. I should also mention that their whipped cream is always perfectly whipped. I ended up ordering one of their specials called Fried Chicken Cathead Biscuit Sandwich-fried chicken, sausage gravy, a biscuit and your choice of potatoes or grits of which I picked the grits. It was definitely a sandwich I had to eat with a knife and fork but oh so tasty. The chicken was crunchy and the meat was still moist, the biscuit was of a cakey sort and the gravy was rich and full of chunks of sausage! The grits were also good, nice and creamy and full of flavor.

We also ordered their Screen Door Praline Bacon, OMG. If you love bacon you have to try this which I believe they only serve at brunch. You get three strips of bacon and they are packed with pecans. They salty and sweet and not really on the crunchy side but that's because there's so much happy goodness going on on that piece of bacon. It just begs for an accompaniment of a good waffle. I can't wait to go to brunch there again and maybe that time I'll order the fried chicken and waffles...with a side of praline bacon.

So, I can see the appeal in Screen Door. It was my first visit, and everything on the menu sounded amazing. I have been eyeing this place for some time and finally made it for lunch. I read some reviews and decided to get the chicken and waffles and the cat fish po boy. For appetizer, the praline bacon.

The bacon was delicious, I have to say. I've tried a similar style of bacon at a nearby joint, but I found the other version too nutty and overly sweet. Screen Door has perfected this balance. As far as the entrees, the chicken was certainly flavorful and juicy, but my fiance found himself craving some dark meat on the bone probably should've gotten the drumsticks instead); and in ordering the po boy, I have realized that I do not like catfish. It was my first time, and I just don't prefer the flavor. I ended up removing the catfish and replaced it with a piece of fried chicken that came with the waffle. In the end, we left feeling heavy and unsatisfied.

I really think it must be personal preference though because of all the stellar reviews on here. At least, that is what I'm going to chalk it up to this time. I will probably try again someday and see if I can change my review. (The biscuits and gravy looked amazing.)

We got the fried oysters, which were incredible. The batter was perfect and a great teaser to get us excited for the fried chicken. 

I got the Screen Door option, which was 3 sides plus cornbread. I chose the 4 piece fried chicken wings (which were way bigger than I was expecting and deep fried into perfection), mac n cheese (so rich, I'm lactose intolerant and frankly this was worth it), and gumbo (I'm no expert on gumbo but this was amazing and the small bowl was filling). The cornbread was dense and not sweet, so I was a little disappointed at first but then I ate it with the honey butter and I couldn't get enough. I only wish they gave more of it.

There were already 10-12 people in line when we showed up, and by the time they opened the door, there was easily 40 people total in line.

We ordered the pork belly appetizer, which was good.  I also ordered the Scarlet O'Hara cocktail, which was dangerously delicious.  For entrees, I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which I just thought was okay.  My husband ordered the brisket which he felt was also sub-par.  We had a side of macaroni and cheese which is by the far the best I have ever had in a restaurant, and I am kind of obsessed with mac and cheese.  Our desserts were also ridiculously amazing.

We came by around 12:30 PM and there was a huge line and an estimated hour wait for us. Obviously since I've come so far, I didn't feel like being a quitter. We walked around the neighborhood and eventually ended up getting a snack from the Cheese & Crack Snack Shop (no regret). 

After an hour we finally got seated in their dining area outside. It was a cold and chilly day in December but they had outdoor heating coming from the ceiling lamps so that was pretty considerate! We came into the restaurant with our carry-on luggage since we were going to catch a flight after brunch and the staff was very considerate, they kept our luggage in their office so it wouldn't get in our or anyone else's way (thanks!). 

It was already 1:30 PM when we sat down (they close weekend brunch at 2:30 PM) but the restaurant itself was still packed from wall to wall. Clearly, this place is poppin'. After seeing stacks of chicken and waffles served to tables all around us, we ordered their two most popular dishes.

* Praline Bacon *
This is dangerous. Slightly sweet, slightly salty, slightly savory, plenty fatty. I was expecting the bacon to be more crispy but this bacon is served quite soft. It was delicious but anymore than a couple bites felt too heavy, on my body and my soul. Perfect to share!

* Fried Chicken & Waffles *
Pancake stacks are so yesterday; it's all about a stack of fried chicken atop a thick and fluffy waffle now. The batter is very flavorful, with flakes of black peppercorn all over it. The chicken is moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. The sweet potato waffle was soft and airy, almost like a sponge (delicious). You can actually taste the sweet potato flavor!

    * biscuit: perfectly flaky, buttery, but not greasy - must order
    * veggie sausage: above average - not a must order
    * veggie gravy: BEST I've ever had, it was mushroom, which most veggie gravy is and had just the right amount of pepper.  It came in a gigantic tub, which I thought was excessive, but what do you know, I finished it all and wanted more! - must order
    * grits: pretty good, creamy, but still light and flavorful - not a must order
    * fruit salad: very good, grapes, pears, grapefruit, and pomegranate, not a must order, but definitely a good addition to what was otherwise a pretty heavy meal

One of my friends ordered a pimento cheese and bacon sandwich and he loved it.  The other made his own breakfast too and also was very pleased.  We also shared winter squash and ricotta beignets tossed in cinnamon sugar with powdered sugar, which was a special and were very good, not too sweet or greasy, reminiscent of hush puppies - almost a must order, but not quite.

It is deservedly the BEST dining experience, even with the wait, I've ever had. For starters, you can PARK! There is ample parking on the streets surrounding this little gem. There was garden porch seating when we were there (it's May 2nd) as well as bar and booth and table indoors. You can grab a cup of joe while you wait, just walk up and get one, or order your poison from the bartender. Lots of bloody mary's were tearing out of there, and few screwdrivers as well.

After a mere 50 minute wait, and it was SO WORTH IT, we were seated at a table inside, and I was luckily facing the kitchen. It's a large, beautiful open kitchen. You can see the guys and gals doing their thang back there, and it's ALL GOOD. We had to order the chicken and waffle, having heard from far and wide how extraordinarily good it is. IT WAS. BY FAR. THE BEST. FRIED CHICKEN. AND WAFFLE. I'VE EVER HAD.

I'm not kidding. This is a fattsy talking, with lots of poundage of fried goodness from up and down the West Coast. I've got POUNDS of experience, and this is IT. By God, you can't get any fresher, any crisper, any juicier, chicken. You can't get a fluffier but dense, light but heavy, crispy but creamy waffle, done to PERFECTION, anywhere on the left coast. And if you can - PLEASE TELL ME, I'll go there. But seriously, you have to try this place. I mean, how much worse can the wait get? No one is sad, no one is antsy, everyone in line is happy just to be alive and getting ready to eat at this place.

There's also a line-up of three benedicts with REAL hollandaise sauce, yes real. There are a bevy of skillets that we saw come out and they looked SO fresh and vibrant and clean, and they have an appetizer of a breakfast corn dog, hand dipped sausage, that the neighboring table said was the BEST CORN DOG SHE HAD EVER EATEN.

Go here. I hope you too get Eric, our excellent server! Give him a hug for his recent rough patch.  He filled our coffees up PRONTO and I mean fast. I had at LEAST 4 refills - and he's good with the advice too. He steered us to gravy on the side, and honest to pete - this is better than my OWN gravy, which should be in a museum of the best gravy ever made by a human being. So i abdicate the throne and hand my title to the chef(s) at the SCREEN DOOR. I bow to you in the chicken, waffle and gravy departments. HONESTLY, YOU GUYS ARE WICKED-GOOD. I WILL BE BACK!!!

The food is awesome and I won't get into that. My review is solely about their reservation system: they'll let you reserve a table as long as you have 6 or more in your party.  For dinner service, the only time they'll take a reservation for is 5:00 - the time they open. They're very clear at the time you make the reservation that you must be there, with all six people, within 15 minutes or they will give your table away. The problem is, you still have to wait in line to tell them you have a reservation. If that takes longer than 15 minutes, you're out of luck. Try to cut in line and tell the hostess you have reservations could result in an ugly confrontation with others.  When we got to the front of the line and I told the hostess we had reservations she made a big deal about asking if all 6 of us were there. I thought about telling her 'what the hell does it matter when we had to wait in line like everyone else?'  Figured that conversation was above her pay grade and pointless so, let it go. They really need to start their seating process by calling out the names of those with reservations when they open and then 15 minutes later to be fair.  Someone to organize the waiting line (at least some exterior markings, ropes, etc) to indicate the structure of the waiting line would help. There were a few scumbags who felt they were better than everyone else and blatantly just came in the opposite direction of the formed line and forced their way in.",XusvvWchjc9ToYTv0qH6AQ,2337 E Burnside St,"Caterers, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern, Event Planning & Services, Bakeries, Cajun/Creole, Food",Portland,45.5230858,-122.64168000000001,Screen Door,97214,7219,4.5,OR,3

My bf and I previously came on a late Sunday morning and line was crazy with a bunch of people waiting both indoors and outdoors. After finding out that we would have to wait 1.5 hours to be seated, we left and decided to come back the next morning. We got up extra bright and early and arrived by 9 AM. No line at all and no wait to be seated, but it was most likely because it was a Monday morning when everyone is at work. Fast forward to ordering, I decided to go with the Texas Veggie Migas and my bf got the fried chicken biscuit sandwich. We waited awhile for our food to come out, which kind of sucked. The scrambled eggs in my dish were plenty flavorful with the pepperjack cheese, chiles, salsa, and onion with a side of crunch factor from the tortilla chips. Eating it with the tortilla made it taste like a well put together breakfast burrito. I don't think my dish was all that special though. If I had the right ingredients, I could have easily made it at home. My dish also came with a side of cheesy grits, which I barely touched and didn't bother to finish since I'm not a huge fan of grits anyway. I ended up not finishing my meal because it was way too much and I left feeling overly stuffed. My bf on the other hand enjoyed his fried chicken biscuit sandwich. I would say that it is hard to go wrong with that type of food because how hard can it be to make?? He didn't finish his grits either and agreed that they weren't really that good. Our waitress was pretty attentive with refilling our water and asking us how our food was, which we appreciated. There was also another waitress walking around asking people if they wanted coffee, so my bf said yes, but didn't realize until we got the bill that we were charged for it. So here is a fair warning! The coffee isn't free and they won't let you know. It didn't taste that great either, just plain coffee with the option of milk/creamer.

There are two types of hyped restaurant, those that don't deserve and those do Screen Door certainly is in the latter. The theme is trendy southern brunch/comfort food, grits , po boys and of course their claim to fame: chicken and waffles . I had the Chicken and Waffles- its a crispy, not too salty and enjoyable to the last bite. It dosen't require much syrup (though that is good too). The waffle, which I think is often neglected is sweet and nice and compliments the chicken super well. Big southern portions, I had only 1 chicken and thought it was plenty. Its on par with what I had at Roscoes in LA. 

Drinks were quite good as well. The Bloody Mary was ranked  among the top in Portland. I thought it was unique with okra, though it was definitely on the spicy side ( I prefer more tomato). It was extra big and packed a good alcohol punch! Mimosa was standard. 

Despite being packed all the time- the service was impressive, they were attentive and gave great recommendations. Parking is street, lots of places around the block as its in a residential neighborhood. 

Overall- its great no doubt. Just sad that its impossible to get to as tourists and locals fight for a spot.

Hands down this was the best fried chicken I have had. First of all it was HUGE!  We had already attempted to consume a few appetizers - hushpuppies that were worthy of the visit alone - perfectly crispy cooked accompanied by this creoley mustard that we all fought over...and finally asked for a second cup of so we could all take turns trying to lick the last goodness out of it.  Butter lettuce for around $7 seemed a bit much until they backed the produce truck up to this platter sized dinner salad. It must have been at least two heads of perfectly fresh lettuce with yummy blue and bacon.  There is another meal unto itself.  Simple salad done way well.  Add some of the best shrimp & grits I have ever had and we were done & stuffed and way happy before the main meals even hit the table.

We all almost jumped back from the table when the fried chicken arrived.  It looked like an entire chicken on a plate it was massive - steaming hot, uber crispy and perfectly seasoned with secret herbs and spices.  YIKES!  We wanted to asked for a bucket right then and there!  

Did I mention it was 90F outside and ...maybe the same inside. HOT STUFF!  None of us could resist and had to start picking at these birds.  OMG! There has to be some sort of crack in these things, because we could not stop eating them even though every part of sanity and our waist lines were crying out like babies for us to stop the madness.

Yummmm! 

Fried chicken and waffles - very interesting! I thought the fried chicken was pretty tasty and not too oily, however I was a bit confused with the waffle flavoring. Wasn't too sure about chicken and waffles eaten together, so I ended up eating them separately and they were pretty tasty. I definitely liked it, but my goto would be biscuits and gravy.

I have been meaning to write a review about this place.  I ate here last year and the Screen Door STILL makes me yearn for the Vegetable Hash.  

The restaurant is a house, small in size but large enough to where you don't feel like you're sitting in the laps of the diners around you.  This place was packed when we went but the free coffee made the wait bearable. 
 
The Vegetable Hash was made up of butternut squash, brussel sprouts, onions and potatoes.  The vegetables were roasted then mixed together with a bit of seasoning.  The mixture of vegetables were heavenly!  My husband had a great dish of a biscuit with a piece of fried chicken and of course gravy.  Everyone that worked there was friendly and made sure we were doing alright.   I love the fact that they did not follow the ""normal"" breakfast.

Went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Took about 40 minutes for a seat and another 15 minutes for the food to arrive after ordering. Was that hour wait worth it to try the Screen Door? Simply, Yes.

The price is definitely higher than normal but you do get huge portions and people still come and eat. Service was superb; they came around filling water constantly. Open kitchen so you can look and see what they do. There is outdoor seating and a bar with six seats. There is one single use restroom for each gender, so there will be a line. 

The most highlighted and featured item at Screen Door is the Chicken+Waffles. Three crispy fried chicken on top of a warm waffle [$14.75]. This was huge, delicious, and filling. Words can not describe. Cutting into that chicken, it was so moist and glistened in the dimly lit restaurant. Perfect crispy batter and thick juicy pieces of meat. The waffle alone or paired was  fabulous. Crunchy exterior and fluffy goodness inside. It was made perfectly. The whole dish was in sync. 

Fried Oyster Breakfast Po Boy [$14.75]. This is big. Served with cheesy grits. They did not skimp in the oysters and each bite I definitely got the meatiness of the protein. Crispy onions was on point and the bread sealed the deal. Egg was cooked perfectly that the yolk just oozed out and smothered every delicious bite. 

One biscuit and gravy [$5.50] and Praline Bacon [$5.75] was oh so good. This is stuff you dream about. The biscuit was fluffy and complemented well with the pool of gravy. The Screen Door praline bacon came with three meaty pieces. Coated with the pecans and sweetened with the cayenne brown sugar. This combination works well and very unique added to an already all star bacon item. 

Come here early or if you got a bigger group, you can call in for a reservation. Look at the menu as you wait so you know what to order when you get your seat. Every item on the menu looks really good. Hope you enjoy their hearty food like I did. It does not compare to the screen door you have at home.

I was very satisfied with the fried chicken. It was super crispy and the chicken was tender, moist and still hot from the fryer. I'm thinking the food took awhile to come out because the fried chicken comes out super fresh...otherwise it just takes forever because there are so many people. Also, I really liked the sweet potato waffle that comes with the chicken. I would definitely recommend this dish to anyone who is a first timer to Screen Door.

I have Celiac Disease and can't eat anything with wheat. Usually I can get around it by smelling what everyone else is eating and having a nice salad without croutons or dressing.  As I was cruising the menu (and really taking a long time about it) they asked if I needed recommendations--I explained my situation, and they produced a detailed menu which had highlighted which items were already gluten-free, and which ones could be adapted. 

I selected an ""adapted"" menu item of catfish, but then noticed that the patrons around us were served first. Later, our meals arrived and the waiter/manager/bartender explained to us that my catfish was accidentally breaded with the standard breading--which contained wheat, and in their cross-checking procedure, they caught the error, so they remade both meals (so that my husband's would be hot when mine was).

Notorious for?
- FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLES: Do you love fried chicken? Do you love waffles? Well you can order this dish and end up having it last you for two meals. Or if you like to be nice, you can share. I just say this because your dish is monstrous. With that, you get three pieces of delightful fried chicken which is very MOIST if I may add. And the waffles? If you love sweet potato, they make their waffles a sweet potato version. And this compliments the dish in the whole Southern essence that it is. You can't go wrong ordering this dish at all!!!!!!

- BLOODY MARY: I've never really been a Bloody Mary drinker until I had Screen Doors! I love how peppery their drink is. So simple and garnished with an olive and okra (to give that Southern essence). One of my favorites in my book! It's just as notorious as Tasty N' Sons Bloody Mary. (Which one is better? Depends on your taste palette).

- OYSTER BENEDICT: If you are a fan of eggs benedict, try their oyster version because it's quite delish! Served with a side of hash and fresh fruit. The hollandaise sauce is so rich and the oyster adds a bit of salt. You get this rich dish that is quite heavy - in the end your taste buds are thanking you that you ordered this dish. The oyster comes in a scramble version if those of you don't like benedict. 

- BANANA FOSTER FRENCH TOAST: If you have a sweet tooth and you like your breakfast sweet, then you may like the french toast! Make that the Banana Foster version! You can totally taste the rum-caramelized within the bananas. The French toast come in 4 colossal sized pieces which is accompanied with fresh fruit as well. I couldn't finish this dish either so it'll be nice to share as well. Or have two meals if you want to be greedy. 

I've never had a disappointing brunch here. I've actually had ordered what they are notorious for and love every single dish! And the service is phenomenal. You are well taken care of over here. Place is hustling and bustling. One of these days I have to try out their dinner fare. 

FYI: they open for brunch at 9 AM. And people start lining up around 830 AM. Plan accordingly. (Or send one person to hold your place in line and sleep in a little more and get there when it's closer to 9.) And parking is located on the street or neighborhood streets.

The place is small...I get why they don't take reservations ( I guess, maybe?) and we were a large party but from the moment we sat down until the time we left I got the impression from our waiter that he was just annoyed with having to serve a larger table.  Maybe he was just having an ""off"" night, but we were almost treated with an air of disdain and annoyance and he was really
 dismissive when I asked him a simple question about the menu. If you don't want larger parties in your restaurant, why allow the reservation to be made in the first place?

The place was nice and hip as they had a classic look of a restaurant with the old wooden chairs accenting the tables. 

They don't have the option of eating chicken and waffles but I was not going to let that deter me from having the chicken to which I was blown away by. It was clearly just chicken and mashed potatoes and trust me, this was not a mere helping of the two elements. They give you a good helping of potatoes to go along with a medium piece of boneless chicken as well as the GIANT piece of chicken breast. I saw two people share this very dish that I am describing but for a big guy like me, I thought I could take it down myself......I failed.

I had a good portion of the big piece of chicken left which made for a good breakfast the next day. My girlfriend had the ""build your own plate"" with a fried pork chop, mac and cheese, and Brussel sprouts and a cheddar biscuit. She nearly finished her plate as well so the mac n cheese was a great touch to my leftovers.

After we finally brave the crowds to experience brunch on the scene, then I'll reconsider and write again to determine whether or not this truly is ""As good as it gets"" 5 star.


First, I and my entire group absolutely love their catfish. And their pan-fried chicken. The pullet of course is SO hyped I thought a let-down was probable, if not inevitable. Alas we got a huge order of it, and it was devoured instantly, as were the creamy, buttery taters and chicken gravy. Damn, how is it that ANYONE south of the Mason Dixon line lives past the age of 35, eating such victuals, even occasionally? After multiple trips through the south, and long before I discovered the Screen Door, I came to recognize southern cooking not as regional cuisine or even ""really, really good"" regional cuisine, but a gift from the heavens, bestowed on humanity for the ages. Screen Door does a very nice job bringing we in the PNW a very reasonable interpretation of that divine gift...


If lovin' Screen Door's brisket is wrong, I don't never, ever wanna be right. Like crushed velour, it tickled the senses, tickled the palate, then tickles your fancy. This is precisely the sort of slow cooked mastery that enables you to savor the meal hours, and perhaps even days later. Take a nice hot shower, or steam sauna, and you'll experience the meal anew, erupting through your pores....


I also loved Screen Door's vinegary, spicy, ham-infused Collard Greens. I for one am someone who never tires of eating his greens! SD's dirty beans and rice are also top notch. The mac n cheese, while good and even note-worthy, suffers from the saturation in the market we now see; EVERYBODY has what they think is off-the-chain mac-n-cheese. Very hard for anyone to separate from the pack and distinguish themselves w/this dish--- though my personal favorite @ the moment remains Pepper Box, w/the chorizo. Lawd a-mussy!


Screen Door's pulled pork and deep-fried pork chops are odd dogs out on the menu. Didn't care at all for either.... there are natural human limits, vaguely understood and forever unseen, but known by all of us instinctively to protect us from certain lines that just should never be crossed.  Will I get much resistance, or flak, for stating outright that deep-fried pork chops are just NO... not just a skirmish on the frontier, but a flagrant violation. It's sort of reminiscent of recent, very disturbing news stories about how numerous other countries are fully immersed in experimentation, cloning human-animal hybrids. Some lines you just DON'T cross, capisce? It's like tampering in God's Domain.... allow me to step AWAY, so the coming thunderbolts don't deep-fry me, too!    ;p


Someday soon we'll be coming by for that unbelievable brunch I've heard and read so much about. In the mean time, thanks so much to the Screen Door.

I knew I wanted to try the sweet potato waffles (sans the fried chicken-I heard it was good though). My parents ordered Oyster Benedict, my sister had Shrimp 'n grits, and I happily ordered sweet potato waffles topped with banana slices. Our food came out quickly and our waitress was efficient.

Everyone was happy with their food. My waffles were beautifully arranged on a white plate. They were fluffy, sweet potatoey, and delicious.   They have something for everyone on their menu, from the pickiest eaters. They also have a full bar so you can enjoy a libation with your meal.

The first time I came to this Southern Style restaurant, it was around 8pm. There was a huge wait in the waiting area and it may have taken about 30-40 minutes to be seated. 

I ordered the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and collared greens. The fried chicken was a delight and the mashed potatoes were delicious. The collared greens were too bitter for my liking, i'm assuming the flavor is an acquired taste. One thing that it really unique to this restaurant is that they have an organic food menu that is changed weekly depending on what is available through the local growers. I ordered the sauteed broccoli with melted butter and cheese. OH MY GOD, this dish was AMAZING. I love broccoli, and am usually pretty picky as to how it's prepared. This tasted so great and flavorful.

The second time I came to the restaurant I opted to order for take out which was a great idea--didn't have to wait as long for tables to be available! I ordered the Catfish with mashed potatoes and macaroni & cheese. The catfish was fried so nicely and had very great flavor. The mashed potatoes were once again delicious and the macaroni & cheese had a unique flavor, as it wasn't the traditional cheddar cheese that was used. 

All in all, I would come here again. Depending if I was in a time crunch or not, I would either wait or order out. My recommendation to others who are inclined to try Screen Door is to be mindful of what time you go. I would recommend around 5 or 6pm on weekend evenings to get passed the weekend rush.",IFPHSAxhU5jwlRCDqRYvEQ,2337 E Burnside St,"Caterers, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern, Event Planning & Services, Bakeries, Cajun/Creole, Food",Portland,45.5230858,-122.64168000000001,Screen Door,97214,7219,4.5,OR,1

One try and you'll be hooked too. This restaurant needs no favorable review from me for their awesome food. Everyone in town already knows how good it is. That's not why I'm writing this review. Six weeks after I arrived in Portland I met an amazing fella and of course I had to introduce him to Screen Door. He loved this place as much as me. He died two years and a month after we met and fell in love. I continued to go to Screen Door after he died.....alone. The owner David and ALL the staff were so extremely kind to me comping my entire dinner on many occasions. I went there again tonight and completely unexpectedly my dinner was again on the house. This place is not just a restaurant. Having lived in the South for 30 years, it epitomizes Southern hospitality with food and kindness. If you haven't been yet, you don't know what your missing.

I was surprised by my brother who flew in from Dallas, TX and double surprised when I thought we were going to the store only to go to the Screen Door where my grandloves, daughters and their spouses were waiting. It was a surprise birthday dinner party only to be treated horribly by the hostess from hell!
When we arrived, my granddaughter who is 16 went in to say we are here. The horrible hostess yelled at her saying ""We don't seat unless everyone is here and you will lose your reservation!"" My family was finding parks and let out everyone while they parked, as there is no ""real parking space"" only neighborhood. We were a party of 13 but my husband was still finding park and horrible hostess said, ""Either you take your reservation now or you lose it!"" So we sat down thinking it should be no issue to add on two chairs. When my hubby found the park and he and my grandson came in, we asked to add a chair, but here comes horrible hostess on a mission to recite, ""I said you all have to be here, I will see what I can do."" The table next to us connected eyes with me and shook their head. Horrible hostess set up a table on the other side of the restaurant which my brother and grandson sat at so I could sit with my husband. There was a great couple behind me who suggested that they were willing to move to the table so we could be together. I thanked them and told our waiter (by the way the waiter, Matthew, was amazing and did his best to be very kind compared to the evil horrible hostess). Matthew told the horrible hostess that the couple were willing to move, and by her actions and look on her face, she was not having it! She came to the couple and told them they don't have to move, as if we asked them. The couple told her they want to move and she was so nice to them and accommodating like they were royalty. Then she immediately turns to me and said, ""Now look, in the future, if you all are not here they are not going to be seated, you have to all be here!"" I was stunned at her attitude and bit my tongue because at this point, I was fed up with her attitdue and my family and myself just felt she had issues with people of color. She was mean, rude and made our table a spectacal as each time this person went into her rage it drew attention. Shame of her and her nasty attitude.

CHICKEN + ANDOUILLE GUMBO: It was tasty, but honestly forgettable. i remember it being tasting a little bland (but maybe that's because everything else on my plate was super super flavorful? idk). I probably wouldn't order this again. 

SUMMER SQUASH AND QUINOA SALAD: I don't know when they'll ever have this again because it was on their local/organics menu, but honestly it was SOOOO GOOD. All the veggies were super fresh and complemented well with each other but the cherry on top was the refreshing chili lime vinaigrette that it was dressed with. OMG. Amazing.

We were visiting Portland for MLK weekend and when you're traveling, you just want to eat at the best places you can in the shortest amount of time (aka stuff the shit out of yourself).

We were half-full when we arrived at Screen Door, so we tried not to order too much. We ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles, and the Hush Puppies.

I've had a plethora of fried chicken from all over North America, and I am certain and 100% confident that Screen Door has the BEST fried chicken I've ever had. You can even see little specks of flavorful pepper and spices in the fried batter of their delicious juicy white meat chicken. Yea you heard right-- WHITE MEAT. 

I could go on with this review about the Chicken. It is best paired with their hot sauce (a non-labeled vermillion sauce on every table). Waffles were great too-- golden, crispy, and delectable after being drizzled with syrup

The hush puppies were alright-- they didn't stand out to me as much as the fried chicken did, but they were basically fried cornbread with syrup.

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone. Locals, out-of-towners, fried chicken lovers, etc-- you're in for a freaking treat. 

Only regret is that I didn't try other dishes here :(",MsKemQIHcKO1giCn5-ADMA,2337 E Burnside St,"Caterers, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern, Event Planning & Services, Bakeries, Cajun/Creole, Food",Portland,45.5230858,-122.64168000000001,Screen Door,97214,7219,4.5,OR,1

I quickly pulled up a picture of their chicken and waffles, and he was all in. 

They opened promptly at 9 am and sat just about everyone in line, which was pretty cool. Tip: it may be hard to come with a larger group, and since it was just us two, we were able to get seated right away. 

Given that we were pretty far back in the line, it took awhile for our food to get to us. But waiting inside with a hot cup of coffee beats standing outside in the cold in November any day.

We sat in the covered outside seating near the road. We started off with the Bloody Mary's, Praline Bacon, and the Sausage Gumbo.

BLOODY MARY - Great Flavor! It did not come very spicy so you might have to ask for a little extra kick! Or just pour down of their habanero sauce and mix that in. You get Okra, Lemon, and an olive. The best part was the flavored salt mixture they coated around the ring of the glass. Very tasty. 

PRALINE BACON - The bacon was a little too sweet for me. There was too much praline and maple sugar to truly enjoy the savory nature of the bacon. It comes with three prices of bacon but this was a dish I would have been okay having one bite of. 

SAUSAGE GUMBO - Well done. A scrumptious little cup of gumbo topped with white rice. It was a percent little starter to the rest of my meal.

Then we moved into the main courses. I had the screen door chicken basket. I have heard amazing things about their chicken and waffles but I don't personally like chicken and waffles (I know, don't shoot me!) Honestly the chicken and waffles looks phenomenal and one of the girls we came with was blown away. 

CHICKEN BASKET - There was the option of wings, drumsticks, or fried chicken strips. The waitress recommended the drumsticks but I was having wings later that day and decided to go with the fried chicken strips instead. I am glad I decided to try the chicken they are known for. It was superb! The fried breading around the chicken was light and flaky and the chicken melted in my mouth. It came with a buttermilk ranch (that was a little dill heavy), crystal hot sauce (goes great mixed with the ranch), and a homemade habanero sauce to add a little kick if you like it spicy. 

Shrimp Po Boy - My girlfriend got this and boy were we surprised! The portion was huge! We were so excited to eat that we forgot to take pictures at the beginning g of the meal. The pictures shown are our meals half eaten. She loved the Po' boy! There was so much shrimp and dressings in the sandwich she needed more sauce so we poured the ranch and crystal sauce on it... great decision. 

Overall an amazing experience 

CONS - I think this place could be getting a 5 star rating based off of dishes alone but there were a few things that threw me off. 

1. The French fries! All of the dishes looked amazing and did not disappoint... but the French fries were elementary at best. They did not have a lot of flavor and were a little soggy. They honestly reminded me of some fast food style French fry. Their only redeeming quality was the ketchup.

My friend and I bookmarked this restaurant while planning our Portland trip, and every Portland local mentioned it as a must-try so how could we not visit?! 

We heard that there is usually a wait, but assuming we were visiting on a Tuesday morning, we hoped it wouldn't be too bad. We waited a bit for the hostess to greet us, but we were promptly seated outside once she got to us. Our waitress was also really sweet & attentive and made sure we were enjoying everything. 

| f o o d |
The menu was heavily influenced by Southern cuisine with grits, fried chicken, and biscuit options. We got 2 dishes to share! 

1. Fried Chicken & Waffles: you have the option of 1, 2, or 3 pieces of fried chicken, but I thought 1 piece was enough for us. I liked that the chicken wasn't greasy at all. It was so tender and crispy!! The sweet potato waffles were good and fluffy. There was a cinnamon/nutmeg taste to them, which I wasn't too fond of because I don't like those spices, but it wasn't overpowering so I didn't mind too much.
2. Buttermilk Biscuit With Gravy (w/ sunny side up eggs): OoOOO get an egg because it helps offset the heaviness of the biscuits. The sausage gravy was a good consistency, and the biscuits were thick but not too dense. 

These 2 dishes combined was enough to fill us up without having leftovers.

I've read reviews and there's always a long wait for this place! I decided to come 15 minutes before opening on a Saturday morning and my friends and I were already the third group in line. By the time the restaurant opened for us to be seated, there was a line wrapped around the corner.

You're greeted once you walk in and servers are incredibly friendly. Our server started us off with drinks and gave us time to decide what we wanted to order. She made sure to stop by to refill our waters, provided us with to go boxes, and gave us our check all promptly!

[FOOD]
-  Fried Chicken and Waffle (5/5) 
A sweet potato waffle topped with 3 massive pieces of fried chicken. Let me tell you, the waffle was INCREDIBLE! I've never had a sweet potato waffle that had the perfect balance of sweet. It was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and just so good. The fried chicken was also amazing. Boneless, light and crispy batter, and juicy chicken. The batter was peppery and gave it a kick of spice. I absolutely recommend this dish.

- Fried Oyster Benedict (4.5/5)
3 fried oysters with eggs benedict and a side. You have to get the potatoes as your side for this dish. The eggs benedict was good, like any average eggs benedict, but the fried oysters and potatoes are where it's at. The potatoes are seasoned so well and the oysters aren't overwhelmed by a ton of fried batter.

Chicken and waffles - we had a choice of 1-3 pieces of chicken. Our waiter told us that a piece consists of a 6 oz chicken breast and that if we were ordering anything else (which we intended on doing) that 1 piece was plenty. He was right. The chicken breast was a huge piece of juicy tender well seasoned, well breaded, crispy piece of heaven. Omg. The waffles were made with sweet potatoes. The perfect combination of crispy and soft. Honestly you can't go wrong with ordering this.

Fried chicken and biscuit - for anyone who likes a savory and hearty breakfast this is perfect! The biscuits were soft yet flakey. The gravy was delicious and honestly I don't know how they get chicken breast to be so moist and not dry. This was my boyfriends favorite. Came with a side of cheesy grits. We don't eat grits so I can't say I'm thrilled by the texture but it wasn't bad!

Praline bacon - $7.50 for 3 pieces of bacon but I had to try. It seemed so intriguing. If you're a fan of salty and sweet this is perfect. But it was too sweet for the two of us. We ended scrapping off the praline and adding it to our sweet potato waffle and problem solved. Delicious.

Food: Food was pretty tasty, I ordered the signature chicken and mashed potato plate and collard greens. It was delish, no dispute about that. Also tasted the shrimp and grits appetizer and the beet and arugula salad which again was very tasty. Jambalaya and Red Beans and Rice were excellent. Our problem with the food is that it took 50 min from the time we ordered to arrival to our table. With 2 kids and one that is a wacky autistic guy, all that waiting in the hot ass hotbox was too much, so we really ate in 8 minutes and had to bail, it was too much for our kids.

i ended up ordering the lemon blueberry pancakes with a side of the breakfast potatoes, and my husband had the chicken & waffles. everything was SOOOOO good! the best was definitely the chicken, it was cooked to crispy, juicy perfection. i didn't really like to eat it with the waffle, my husband would just cut off little pieces for me that I'd either eat plain or drench in hot sauce. the portions were also HUGE and the prices were not too bad. it's such a shame we don't live in the area, cuz we would be here all the time if we were!",nC_EoDiWqT798FPiDd2OyQ,2337 E Burnside St,"Caterers, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern, Event Planning & Services, Bakeries, Cajun/Creole, Food",Portland,45.5230858,-122.64168000000001,Screen Door,97214,7219,4.5,OR,1

I was doing the Great Pacific Northwest road trip and of course had to stop into Portland so I checked out fellow Yelpers had to say on great eats in this area and Screen Door came out on top so naturally of course I had to go check it out.

I came in at 10:30am and there was already a crazy line-up outside. I gave my name to the hostess and because it was just me, I was able to get a seat at the bar, but it was a good 40 minute wait. Not that I minded, I got to people watch and look over the menu. FYI: if you're looking to get a table for 2, waits are about 2 hours by 10:30am on a weekend.

When I was finally seated, I ordered up a Bloody Mary, it was spicy and tangy to perfection with a pickled okra to boot. The bartender who also took our orders does a stellar job. The people here work their asses off and it was easy to see why given the crowds. But the crowds are huge because of one thing only: the food.

Of course I ordered the fried chicken for my first time here. And some monstrous  piling tower of three large chicken breasts, perfectly spiced, breaded and fried with a giant knife pinning it together on top of a sweet potato waffle showed up. It was fried food heaven. There was no way I was ever going to finish off such a huge portion. This is dinner for a couple or a small family. Thankfully, there was another lone diner seated beside me at the bar and she was having their super-fluffy French Toast. We got chatting together and she said she was a regular and always has the fried chicken but wanted to try something else today and  so I proposed a trade, I gave her a piece of my chicken and I got to try that awesome French toast

This is definitely Southern cuisine done right. I saw omelets with oysters, Bourbon sauce bread pudding, and a ton of other stuff I wished i could have tried.

There might be a line:
Most people recommend this place for brunch, so that's exactly when we went. My husband and I got to the restaurant right when it opened Sunday morning at 9am. There was literally already a line of at least 20 people deep waiting outside, so that must be a good sign right? We probably only waited in line about 30 minutes before being seated, which wasn't too bad. 

Parking isn't so bad:
We parked for free about 2 blocks away from the restaurant in a residential area. There's street parking all around the area and the restaurant is nustled in a quaint neighborhood but still on the main road, so you can't miss it (especially with the line of people waiting outside haha).

When you finally get inside:
It has southern country style and decor, as to be expected with the type of food they serve. We were surrounded by friendly staff left and right, from the hostess, to our waitress, and lastly the guy at the bar who kindly pointed me in the direction of the bathroom. They have benches inside to sit on while you wait for your table and self serve coffee to keep you warm and awake behind the hostess desk. Be fore warned though, if you pour yourself a cup of joe, you will have to pay for it, it's not free. 

The whole reason we came here:
I ordered the blood orange mimosa, which was just as delicious as a regular mimosa if not even better and my husband ordered this coffee liquor drink that I can't remember the name of but it's was still memorable! As for entrees, he got the Fried Oyster Breakfast Poboy, which had fried oysters, bacon, and over medium eggs and cheese grits on the side. Ugh, it was a gigantic mouthful but my husband devoured every last delicious bite. 

As for me, I ordered the Low Country Shrimp and Grits with eggs and a biscuit on the side. Hands down the best shrimp and grits I've ever had, the flavors were mind blowing! After taking the first bite, I was hooked. Truly, love at first bite. 

We didn't ordered this, but pretty much everyone else around us did and it was the praline bacon. It looked so good, kind of regret not getting it.

So, lessons learned: go early as possible, come with an empty stomach so you can eat as much as possible, and probably order the praline bacon.

There's a couple of great coffee spots nearby that are worth checking out while you wait. I ordered the fried chicken biscuit sandwich and a side of their praline bacon. 

The bacon was super rich to the point where I wasn't able to finish it. It's a wonderful combination of sweet and savory and salty. I'd recommend splitting this with a group. It doesn't look like a lot of food, but it's hard to eat a lot of, even if it's so delicious.

Anyone visiting Portland should try this place. Not only is the service so great, but you can call in earlier to put your name down (why don't more places do this?). 

The food is just all around amazing. I had the griddle stack burger and it was just a large ooey gooey delicious burger. Probably one of the best I have ever had. The burger had some sort of tomato-y sauce, but upon inspection of their menu, it was likely a combination of the pimento cheese and smoked scallion mayo. Just a great combination of meat, cheese, sauce, etc. A slam dunk in my book. 

I also got to try the mac n cheese and that was all around solid. Friends had the fried chicken and couldn't stop raving about it. Everyone at our table was pleased with all their dishes, so all items may be a safe bet. 

One thing to note is that the portion sizes are very large. One meal could likely feed two people to a sufficient level or even to the brim.

I ordered the 1 piece chicken and waffle along with their Mac and cheese to split with a friend. The fried chicken was well seasoned and crispy while the chicken was juicy and fried to perfection. The thickness of the chicken is key - too thin and it's dry and too thick it's a little too much chicken to chicken skin crunch ratio. The thickness of the chicken at Screen Door is perfect.

The sweet potato waffle is a great pairing as well. I personally love lathering the chicken and waffle combo with a hot sauce and syrup mixture.

I'm a big fan of Cajun food so I definitely wanted to check this place out during my short trip. Free street parking wasn't too bad to find around the neighborhood. This place gets really busy so try to get here early or come on a weekday if possible. Unfortunately I'm only visiting this weekend and came around 12pm on Saturday, probably one of the worst times to get there. My friend and I waited ~45 mins for our seats at the bar which was less than the 1 hour wait estimated by the hostess. However, we also probably waited about 45 mins to get our food after ordering which seemed abnormally long. 

I got the cathead sandwich which was a fried chicken breast sandwiched between a homemade  biscuit and covered in sausage gravy. I heard the fried chicken was amazing so I definitely wanted that, but not a big fan of waffles so this seemed like the best choice. I thought it was one of the juiciest fried chickens I've ever had, especially since it was white meat! The spices were really flavorful without being too salty and the meat was very tender. I probably missed out on some of the crispiness because it was drenched in gravy, but the gravy was good so not a big deal. I'd probably order it on the side next time. The biscuit was fluffy and delicious as well. It comes with a side of roasted potatoes or plain/cheesy grits. I got the cheesy grits, but these were mostly neglected since the chicken and biscuit/gravy were so good. This dish is enormous and I barely ate half, probably could have shared with another person and still been super full. 

My friend got an omelette with vegetarian sausage, tomatoes, and other veggies with roasted potatoes. He liked it, but I thought my dish was way better :P

You can't expect anything free here for your birthday event. It's awful, IMO. 
Street parking. 


- Gluttony Expedition - 
Entrees are around $15 +, appetizers are $5 ~10. Everything has a big portion, but a bit pricey for the quality (in terns of taste) compared with other good OR restaurants.

Screen Door's favorite: You can pick 3 sides. 
1) Fried catfish: Though the batter got spices, fish lacked in flavors. Bland.

2) Mac & cheese: Heavy cheese flavors, hot and cooked well. Not bad. 

3) Beet salad: Very light, flavorful and hearty. Good.

Corn bread: a bit dry side, full of corn flavors, not so sweet. Fancy version of corn bread.

Fried oysters: The appetizer comes with a lot of oysters for appetizer. The batter was very crunchy and lots of spices in it. Not bad, but nothing wow to me.

Desserts: Everything looked heavy - pies, pies, pies etc. 
Vanilla ice cream: It's good. I paid for it for my birthday friend despite I specifically mentioned my server about the ""surprise"" birthday thing... 


- Conqueror's Deduction - 
Over hyped. It's very light Southern-ish foods. I liked their hearty local ingredient specials but they aren't so much of ""southern"" foods. Carefully executed foods, but lacking in flavors. You can get better foods at breweries/bars in Oregon - Oregon restaurant /food scene has very very high standards. This is a ""restaurant"". 
Very Disappointed.

I don't know why but you see tons of ""Southern Foods"" in Oregon. What's up with that???

Their fried chicken plate is divine, although in Arkansas we would call this ""chicken fried chicken"" because it's fried fillets, not bone in.  It really hits the spot when I miss my granny's cooking. 

Their chicken sandwich lacks sweetness which makes it a little overly salty for me. They should add a sweet element to the base of the slaw, or honey to the breading of the chicken, to balance the flavor. Personal opinion--it ain't really fried chicken if it isn't at least a little spicy. A bit of vinegar based hot sauce in the buttermilk marinade or the batter would be downright lovely. I know you can add it yourself, but I just have to speak up on behalf of good fried chicken. 

Their fried green tomatoes are just like home, and I love their bourbon cocktails and sweet tea. Staff are so kind. I've eaten here alone at the bar and they made small talk with me when I was homesick. I've ordered takeout from them since covid and it was well-packaged, delicious, and still crispy when I got it home. Their beet salad was delicious, too.

After trying fried chicken at nearly every restaurant in Portland, this is my favorite, and the only one made in true Southern style.

It didn't take as long as I expected it to be and I have the help-yourself-Stumptown-coffee at the bar to thank for. Names were called and you either hear some clapping or an excited cheer from the party about to get seated, or crickets because the group had left. Since they close at 2PM (half hour later on weekends) and open again around 5ish, it does not give you much leeway if I say come at an off-peak time but maybe arriving half an hour before opening and closing would help. Maybe.

I went with the popular FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLE ($11.95) and opted for 1 glorious chicken breast vs the 3 pieces a regular order came with. Gotta leave room for the other restaurants we were planning on hitting up that day. Suffice it to say, I could have been fine with 2 pieces with my appetite. The buttermilk coating made for a nice crunch to the exterior and though the chicken was tasty, it wasn't the eye-rolling-moaning-kind-of-good. The sweet potato waffles on the other hand were made with divine intervention - light and airy with a subtle crisp. 

Now, the CHICKEN FRIED PORK SHOULDER ($14.50) was on a whole different level. Fried to a golden perfection, the tender and juicy pork screams flavor across the board with a hearty and delicious sausage gravy to top it all off. This was a far more memorable dish than the fried chicken, I tell you.

Both the service and vibe of this place was endearing and fun. To be handed a plate of CANDIED BACON by the table next to us so we can try a piece was such a random act of kindness that we couldn't refuse no matter how bizarre it was. When in Rome, right? Sweet, salty, and really rich - one bacon was sinfully plenty.

Collard greens were alright, had decent flavor.

The raspberry front porch swing was really great, but I'm still uncertain if they actually put alcohol in there because you definitely couldn't taste it and I didn't even get a slight buzz.

I love the option of choosing how many chicken pieces you want. Their chicken was good but I want to talk about their waffles- the waffles were top tier. It was done just right- crunchy yet fluffy. Their shrimp & grits was the perfect comfort food. It's great especially if it's gloomy weather.

Service was crisp and error-free from start to finish.  Loved the shrimp grits and the hush puppies appetizers.  Also got lots of pleasure from the Rogue Dead Guy Ale!  A bonus too that our plaid-shirted waitress asked if we wanted fresh glasses for our second round of ales.

As expected the signature fried chicken was perfect, which both JP and I ordered.  The smoky taste of the gravy that came with the mashed potatoes evoked in me an image of a crackling campfire.

The pecan pie was very good, but it came with a little dollop of whipped cream, not the vanilla bean ice cream advertised on the menu.

I could not help but say, Mmmm, with every bite I took.  Don't get me started with the sweet potato waffle.  I saw bits of sweet potato when I cut into the waffle.  Our waiter brought us some kind of butter that made the waffle taste like a sweet potato pie!  We didn't even the gravy.  My love got the shrimp and grits.  That did not disappoint either.  Just when he thought he ate all of the shrimp, he was finding more pieces of shrimp throughout his dish.  I washed it all down with an ice cold sweet tea.  That drink was on point.

FOOD - 
+ Chicken & Waffles ($14.95): Best chicken and waffles I've ever had! And it was ENORMOUS. You get 4 giant pieces of chicken that are juicy, lightly battered and huge! I'm really picky about my fried chicken, and I absolutely loved it!! This is a MUST GET :) Every table in the restaurant had an order of this.

+ Fried Oyster Eggs Benedict (~$13): SO GOOD! If you love oysters and eggs benedict, you must get this dish as well. There's only 3 fried oysters, but they were all huge oysters and were so fresh and juicy as well. This dish was so unique, and I would highly, highly recommend it. The eggs benedict themselves tasted like they had a little bit of caramel in them. They weren't anything extraordinary, but the fried oysters made the dish. 

+ Mimosa ($4): Had to :) 

AMBIANCE - 
The atmosphere of the restaurant isn't anything too special. Nothing really stood out. There were just lots of people all the time.

SERVICE - 
Our server was nice but not very friendly. Not sure if that's a Portland thing or not? We had rather strange service at a plethora of different restaurants throughout Portland.

The Fried Chicken Cathead Biscuit Sandwich was a nice choice on my part, although it looks incredibly daunting with all of the breading involved.

The one letdown there was the grits.  They were cheese grits, and the cheddar completely dominated (not in the good way).  They were also a bit on the watery side.

Ended my trip to Portland at Screen Door and it was quite a satisfactory end to a delicious weekend. The lines were pretty long on a Sunday ~12 PM so I'd recommend trying to come earlier if you have a big party. (Pssst, there's a tasty little coffee shop right next door that's a good place to occupy your time while you wait.)

Ordered the praline bacon, shrimp and grits, and the chicken and waffles. I'm a savory over sweet breakfast person and this was just way too sweet. Interesting concept, but it was just way to sweet for my taste buds. The shrimp and grits were pretty good - wish it was a little more seasoned since I ended up using a lot of tobasco to brighten up the flavor. The chicken and waffles was what I was really there for and that did NOT disappoint. They give a lot of chicken and the crispy batter is just perfect with the fluffy waffle.

- Shrimp and grits: Love at first bite. So much flavor packed into this dish. I traded dishes to let my fiancé try and the grits were practically gone when he returned my plate. Not gonna lie, I was pretty upset. You would think 4 shrimp may not be enough, but the grits to shrimp ratio was just right. I had another shrimp leftover after my grits were gone. Not mad at that!
- Fried chicken and waffles: I loved the chicken seasoning - it tasted like french fry seasoning if that makes sense and I mean that in the best way possible. I liked that the sweet potato waffles had cinnamon/pumpkin notes. 
- Praline bacon: Just the right amount of sweetness. My shrimp and grits came with a biscuit, so my fiancé and I made mini praline bacon/scrambled egg biscuit sandwiches. Reminiscent of day after Thanksgiving ham sandwiches. So good. 
- Blueberry lemon curd buttermilk pancakes: Loved everything up until I tried these pancakes. They looked fluffy af but were dry and dense. Would skip these.

Overall Mikes is a big pastry shop on the main street of the north end, where you can get everything from a nice cake, to cookies, cannolis, and petzels. You can go in easily on a weekday around lunch yet during the spring, summer, and any weekend the place is mobbed. I won't judge them for doing a solid business but it would be nice if the staff was a bit friendlyer even during 'rush hour'. 

I grew up going to the North End as a child for St. Anthony's feast starting at 4 weeks old... its a family tradition and I've had my fair share of lobster tails, cannolis, petzels, and other italian favorites. Overall the canolies and other goodies are better than Modern (accross the street), the store is bigger to fit more customers and their wide selection yet I prefer mom and pop bakeries, less commercialized like BOVAS! Just a personal preference... I feel like if your looking for traditional italian and a sense of authentisity mikes is so-so... 

All-in-all the pastries are good but not worth waiting outside, down the block, especially in the  summer heat when you can walk a block or two to a smaller shop and get served within 2 minutes.

Overall, the perfect cannoli -- delicious filling, nice crunchy outer shell -- they also have them available online so you can have them shipped to your house (which I suspect I'll be doing once I'm back in Philadelphia).
I also got coffee for my husband and a freshly prepared cappuccino for myself (it was perfect in every way!).  While I was waiting for my cappuccino to be made, they brought out chocolate covered strawberries and gave me two.  It was just a really fun experience, the whole thing.

I especially loved the dense ricotta filling and pistachio nuts at the ends, and the crispy shell. My bf didn't care for it as much, feeling that cannolis in general were too rich. I will admit it would have been good with a cup of tea or coffee, but I love my sweets so I loved the richness.

I second that completely. Stop reading the reviews and just get over there, before five people get in front of you and you get frustrated. I know you, don't worry. ;)

If you're debating over whether to go to Mike's or Modern Pastry, just go to both. *shrugs* You're likely a tourist anyway, so don't worry if you need to treat yourself multiple times during your trip. :)

Honestly though, even if Mike's is the only place you end up going, you're not making a wrong choice. They have many options for your palate. I got the Pistachio Cannoli and my friend got the Florentine. Both options made a positive lasting impression. The cannoli was sprinkled with pistachios on the outside and mixed on the inside with ricotta/cream filling and more pistachios. What's not to love?

I love the inside of the building. The first thing that catches my eye is the simplicity of the cannoli drawings on the wall. I love it, it adds a cute touch to the place. It is pretty old looking and there aren't a lot of seats, but because it's so busy in there you probably don't want to stick around anyway. Take a left and head to the Paul Revere Park a few streets up. There are plenty of benches to plop down and gobble up your cannoli.

What I found seems to back the traditional findings: at Mike's you pay 50 cents more but it is proportionally bigger and has minutely better presentation (aside from the size and different shaped chocolate chips, they appear identical). As the Modern ones aren't pre-filled, their crust is crispier. Whether or not you prefer this is entirely a matter of taste, it really made no difference to me in my enjoyment of the cannoli's.

Ultimately, both cannolis are five star worthy, the debate is pointless, and the superior establishment is whichever one has a shorter line when you arrive.

""This place is for amateurs.
Betty Crocker
The Pillsbury Dough Boy
Aunt Jemima
and even that pirate hooker from Semi Homemade on the Food Network all hang their heads in shame knowing that y'all think these baked goods taste good.""

That has to be the most accurate thing I have even seen about Mikes. 
Anyone who said they have good pastries is probably right because they have never had pastries anywhere else, because if they did they would realize that mikes pastry has enough sugar in their pastries to give you cavities with the first bite.

If anyone tries telling me the have Italian pastry you are dead wrong too. Italians would never ever ever ever put anywhere close to that much sugar or butter in their pastries. The closest you can come to an Italian pastry in the North end is Modern Pastry and a small caffe that imports them like caffe dello sport or the paradiso. 

By the way if you want a cannoli that was filled yesterday surrounded by a soggy shell, then yes this is your place, as well as the rats in their alley way playing around with their bags of sugar, thats always a sight for soar eyes. I saw that someone mentioned that there are always long lines and no prices, why is that? MARKETING they know how to con all of you! They advertise and commercialize themselves towards Americans that no offense, don't know a good pastry if it hit you in the face. So basically they get all these people who don't know any better telling people it's great. As well as the prices, well they can raise the price at will, and they make people that have never been there before stand in line without knowing the price so when you get to the counter you wont just walk away because you just stood in line for an hour and have to pay a good amount of money, I will say this though, they are not too expensive, although some people may think so, but you need to realize the cost of supplies have gone way up.

- Claim that Mike's cannoli are too rich/too big.
Please stop eating dessert - I'm not sure you really understand it.  There are plenty of places where you can get some nice, light frozen yogurt.  Or maybe a salad.  Why don't you go check those out?

- Complain that the cannoli here is ""not fresh"" because they don't fill the thing right in front of you.
First, just watch for 30 seconds or so and see how quick the turnover is for cannoli.  
Second, taste it.  See how it tastes extremely fresh?  It's fresh.  Now let the grown-ups talk.


I recently went back here after a 2-ish year hiatus, and it was even better than I remembered.  I've tried several of their cannoli and I'm pretty sure I've had the tiramisu and a few other things, but the chocolate covered cannoli with ricotta cream and chocolate chips is the only thing that matters.  In LIFE.  When I'm eating one of these, I literally can't process a single thought outside of, ""HOLY CRAP THIS IS SO DECADENT.""

If you're the kind of person who considers rich desserts an essential part of a happy life, then getting some cannoli here is an absolute must.

I finally waited around 30 minutes on a Saturday night around 7:30 pm. The appeal for me was the variety of cannolis. Most pastry shops in the area only offered the 3 or 4 fillings, with or without chocolate chips and dipped or covered in chocolate. Mike's has so many flavors to chose from. I ended up trying the pecan caramel, limoncello, and ricotta. The pecan caramel was my favorite! The ricotta is better at Modern pastry. These cannolis also seem larger than other places. Besides the cannolis the other pastries looked amazing but I can't speak for their taste. I would say it's worth going once and especially if there's no line.

And so we did on 2 different occasions after eating at Fanueli Marketplace both times. 

My review is based only on the plain, chocolate chip, and chocolate covered canolis as I did not try any of their other pastries. I should remind you that this was my first time eating canoli's so perhaps you might disregard my review in that aspect. However, my mom said it was the best canoli she has ever had. Hype or not, the canoli filling isn't overly sweet and in my opinion just the perfect balance. Fast forward 2 months later...I had a canoli a few weeks ago from Cortina's Italian Market in Anaheim, and while good, is no match for Mike's canoli's. The filling here was much more sweeter.

If I ever return to Boston, I'm paying a visit to all of the pastry shops in little Italy that sell canoli's to see what is the best. Unfortunately online ordering is too expensive, so sadly I'll have to wait and wait to someday return. And so the waiting begins....

am. Reading all these lovely reviews, I finally got the time to stop by one afternoon and try out the original Chocolate Chip Cannoli. 

I mean, usually you can't go wrong with their signature pastry right?

WRONG. What I got was an unflavorful, dry, doughy, and very pasty cannoli. The chocolate chips had no flavor, and it wasn't very sweet. It basically felt like everything that could go wrong in my mouth...went wrong. On one hand I can taste the doughy layer and then completely cannot chew the chocolate chips while having a no-taste cream in the midst of all of it. 

I see people everywhere carrying boxes of their pastries, so I'm very disheartened I didn't have a nice experience here. It's sad to say but I've had better cannolis at the not so great airport in Rome. I am however, totally down to give this place a second chance.

Everything looks amazing there are so many choices from cakes, tiramisus, to cookies and gelato.  I had a very difficult time choosing but I've heard so much about their cannoli. I got their hazelnut cannoli. Coming from an Italian family, I am very particular about cannoli and don't like many other than the ones my grandma made.  However, this one was to DIE for.  The ricotta was smooth as can be and had a slight covering of hazelnut.  The cannoli itself was huge too, definitely pleased with my pick.  My friend tried the peanut butter cannoli which I thought was going to outshine mine, but hers wasn't that fantastic.  The filling was a bit gritty and tasted like an odd combination with the peanut butter and ricotta. I'm sure the others are to die for though.

I have to say their cannoli rolls are def bigger than average. The shell was somewhat crunchy when it was fresh.
I got four flavors: Strawberry, Hazelnut, Espresso and Pistachio. Out of the four, Hazelnut and Espresso were my favorite - I liked the hint of the hazelnut aroma and the coffee bitterness. Everything else was very sweet. The sweetness was so strong and ""blunt"" that blinded me from noticing any other flavors or texture (that's why I don't even remember whether the shell was crunchy...).

They're funny, goofy, a little competitive (Giant 0 - Asian 1) and overall down to Earth. As the giant kept saying, ""No picture or words could ever replicate that moment,"" I really wish I could convey the memory of seeing those three sit on a bench at the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway. They all had a Mike's Pastry in hand, were taking bites, and were in complete silence.

Mike's Pastry was so good it caused everyone to calm down and savour the moment. The giant got the classic tiramisu, Luke had a black and white cookie, and the child got the Boston Cream Puff. I chose the fruit tart and it was perfect in every way. The fruit glistened, the custard wasn't too sweet, and the crust held up nicely. 

All pastries that leave Mike's are wrapped up like presents. It just makes the pastries that much more special. While our tastes in pastries were varied we were all universal on our to go pastry.

One whole box of chocolate mousse cannolis for later! The cannoli was far better than the pastries we had at the park. There's a reason why the cannolis are famous at Mike's.

Walking around the downtown Boston area, I saw a lot of people with boxes with blue lettering on them. I was definitely curious, but was at first deterred by the long line outside the shop. However, my friend and I had some time to kill, so we decided to go for it.

The line was long, but moved very quickly. Once you were in the actual store, it is pure craziness; there are people everywhere, shouting across the room and such. But it's the kind of chaos that you should expect to find at local but very popular establishment. Even when you get into the store, there are cashiers pretty much all around the perimeters of the store, so I waited less than 5 minutes to place my order.

I ordered two chocolate chip, a strawberry and a peanut butter cannoli. And every single one was amazing. 

Having been recently diagnosed with lactose intolerance, I knew it would be a bad idea to eat any of these. But I had to try them; people raved about them too much for me to resist. So I had a tiny bite of the chocolate chip.

And then another bite.

And then another.

Before I knew it, I was halfway done with it. I stopped myself, but boy, did I want to finish that cannoli. I did not care that I would most likely be dying later that night... it was worth every single bite.

Let it be known, these cannolis are divine. The filling is perfect: just the right amount of whatever flavor they claim to be (not overpowering any other flavors, but instead, blended in perfect harmony), not too rich, not too sweet... perfection. The shells were also crispy and delicious, as everything in the bakery itself is made fresh.  

I ended up taking the rest of the cannolis back to New York. They survived the trip back, and although obviously the shells weren't as crisp and perfect as they were in Boston, they were still very good. I had small bites of the strawberry and peanut butter, and hate myself for not being able to finish them off. I might just take a bunch of lactaid pills later and do exactly that.

If you are in the Boston area, I highly recommend getting your hands on these bad boys. And eat them. 

TIP: The best way to eat the chocolate chip cannoli, is to bite into the chocolate chip end first, and munch your way halfway through the shell. Then, finish the other half by starting with the chocolate chip end again. The chocolate flavor sits in your mouth and gives the rest of the cannoli a subtle chocolatey-goodness taste while you enjoy the rest of your uhmazing treat.",2mTwjnVkKC_9WIadiCQAww,300 Hanover St,"Candy Stores, Gelato, Food, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Desserts, Patisserie/Cake Shop, Specialty Food, Bakeries, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt",Boston,42.3641813865,-71.0542184385,Mike's Pastry,02113,7298,4.0,MA,1

First of all he was standing by the window near and outlet totally out of way of the line and everyone else. Secondly the register was shut down and coffee wasn't even being served and NO one was even near there to get coffee even if it was open. She was very rude.

Almost everywhere I've been to and seen a cannoli, I would try it to compare with Mike's, as it was at Mike's Pastry that I had my FIRST cannoli ever. Seriously, no other place compares. I have yet to encounter a better one. Was in Italy last year, but oddly didn't encounter one. Going back again this year, so we will see!

This place is CROWDED all the times I've been here. So be warned. They service you at the counter, and it's a little chaotic, but you can try to find the shortest line and stand there. This place is not for the meek and gentle, because people will cut in front of you shamelessly, so be assertive. Their service is fast, so even if it's crowded, you'll get your cannoli in no time. There are some tables here, but when it's crowded you will be tableless, so my suggestion and what I always do (haha) is go next door to Caffe Vittoria and enjoy a nice cappuccino with your newly acquired goods from Mike's and sit...and relax.

There was a line a few times we were there (try getting there earlier in the day, especially if you're able to go during a weekday, if you want some more time to browse the display case and place your order), but the multiple clerks behind the counter kept things moving. 

The prices were *extremely* reasonable ... two large cannolis and a cupcake were about six dollars ... and most of the clerks were very quick in getting the items and packaging them. I'm not normally a fan of cannolis because I don't care for the filling, but Mike's cannolis were very creamy and delicious, and the cannoli shell was light and flaky instead of heavy and greasy-tasting. We also had a brownie, a chocolate cupcake with white frosting, a slice of Oreo cheesecake and a sfogliatelle/lobster tail, all of which were delicious. 

My only complaint was that one clerk was a little slow in getting my order, at a time when nobody else was in the store. I also asked for a cup of tea to go, and she didn't put any milk in it (sugar is available in packets on the far side of the counter), so I asked another clerk to give me a splash of milk and the second clerk seemed visibly annoyed at the first because the first didn't take care of this for me. But to be fair, the clerk that served me seemed to be new, and I didn't originally ask for anything in my tea (although she also didn't ask how I took it). Not a big deal, nothing worth getting upset over. Also, if you want table service, be prepared to wait (both for a table and a waitress ... we had other people served before us and had to wait over 5 minutes for a waitress to come over, but there was one waitress serving about 7 full tables on a busy day).

Let me say that I LOVE SWEETS. I can wake up in the morning and eat a candy bar - that's what kind of sweet-lover I am. I'm temporarily living in the North End and am so excited because I am near all the pastry goodness. I've tried a bunch of goodies from Mike's so here's what I have to say:

- Oreo cheesecake / Red velvet cheesecake ($4.25): I've had a few of these and have come to the conclusion that I am NOT A FAN of their cheesecakes. I don't know what it is exactly, but the cheesecake is NOT SPECIAL, if anything, kind of bland and generic. I've had better frozen cheesecakes with more flavor. But if you are going to get a cheesecake, I would recommend the Oreo cheesecake because there's more flavor with the Oreo mixed in.

- Red Velvet cake ($3.25?): After trying the red velvet cheesecake I decided to go for red velvet straight up. It was just OK. I was expecting more flavor in the cream cheese frosting but it didn't live up to my expectations.

- Chocolate & Red velvet whoopie pies ($3?): This was okay for what it is. Not spectacular but I'd give it a try. Something you can buy your young kid.

- Lobster tail ($5): I bought this not knowing what a lobster tail was. Boy was I pleasantly surprised to bite into the crispy brown Sfogliatelle and taste that creamy goodness. This is also a pretty dang LARGE treat so it took me a few days to eat it. I've tried the lobster tail at Bova's ($4 for their large which is a little smaller) and for the price/size I'd go with Mike's.

- Cannolis (vanilla, chocolate chip, chocolate, regular) ($3.25?): I'm from CA and had never had a cannoli before. When I discovered what this delicious treat was, I went a little overboard. These cannoli's pre-made are a PRETTY DECENT SIZE. They will ask you if you want powdered sugar on it. One weekend I went out and bought 4..ate them all at once because I have no self control like that and have never eaten a cannoli since. (This was about 3 yrs ago). Since Mike's has been remodeled, they have a lot more cannoli options - which makes me want to try it again.

BOTTOM LINE: If you're a tourist/stopping by the area, I would RECOMMEND this place. You have to try it once and see for yourself. Like the lobster tail, don't recommend the cheesecakes so much.

** SECRET tip: Depending on when you go here, it's packed with people (weekends, nights, some afternoons). With much experience frequenting the shop, I've learned to go in the doors and head to the left end of the counter. I find that people usually stand in the middle foyer of the store figuring out what they want/standing in a line that isn't moving and I am usually ordering my goods and out the door without dealing with that mess.",SAPltgfFSgI1K9aUuOWcXw,300 Hanover St,"Candy Stores, Gelato, Food, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Desserts, Patisserie/Cake Shop, Specialty Food, Bakeries, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt",Boston,42.3641813865,-71.0542184385,Mike's Pastry,02113,7298,4.0,MA,1

I love desserts and pastries and this place is one of my go-to spots. What I love most about this place is their huge selection of cannolis.

My favorite are the Florentine and the Pecan Caramel.

A few tips.. 
1. Avoid going on weekends/tourist peak times. I've never experienced the really busy hours so I don't know how bad it gets but even when there is a small crowd inside, it's a little hard to see all the pastries available.
2. It's cash only.
3. There's really no ""line"" system. People tend to crowd on one side of the counter (usually the right side) when there's ladies waiting to help along the whooooole counter. So if you somehow manage to get to the front, go for it. Don't be timid once you're up front or someone behind you might yell out their order and not care that you were first.

The chocolate chip cannoli is my go-to on a bad day when I just need to have a win. Delicious, sweet, and not too chocolatey (but still quite pleasant). Wonderful prices, and a very dedicated staff to handle the ridiculous lines as quickly as they do. The wait to order is entirely manageable, and the people behind the counter are extremely nice. 

The food is less Italian authentic and more americanized. It, therefore, is a huge tourist spot and is packed most times of the day (though I've managed to come in the morning when it was less crowded before).

Moreover, if anything tells you how great this place is, its the number of people you see that have a Mikes Pastry box on virtually any random street in Boston. Mikes is truly a symbol of Boston.

So I did what any intelligent, hot-blooded, foodie would do and made my way on over to the North Side, a.k.a ""Little Italy"". 

I knew this was definitely THE place to be when I turned the corner and saw the line. It was tempting to skip out and go to either of places adjoining Mike's but I used my quick powers of deduction and stayed put. 3 cannoli places in a row, 2 empty, 1 extra packed. I was in it for the long haul. They have that theme-park-line situation going on. You expect to be rewarded with pastry once you reach the door but you're only greeted with... more line. Fortunately the long haul didn't turn out to be so long. I'd say I was in and out in 20 minutes.

Although they have around 1,000 cannoli variations, I stuck with the classic. How am I supposed to compare this one with actual Sicilian cannoli if I go with a completely different flavor? They looked pretty big but I had just waited in line for a while so I was going for a double. Again, I stuck with the classic because if the first one I eat is as good as people say, I'm not about to mess with perfection and risk getting a crappy flavor. 

We walk out with the signature box that basically everyone is the city seems to carry in their hands. We had just eaten and although I was more than able to have a go at it right away, I thought this could be something worth savoring. 

They say you never forget your first time. I was on my hotel bed, snuggled up under the covers. I'll never forget the way it made my body feel.

Friends who've been to Boston agreed I must try Mike's Pastry. The guidebook my coworker lent me said I must try it. My California-native Boston transplants, now-locals even shared the sentiment. I had never been, but a very kind friend brought a cannoli all the way back to the West Coast for me a few years ago. It was definitely still delicious and, that memory intact, this time I was looking forward to trying it super fresh. 

I decided on the Pistachio.  Il cannolo was as yummy as I expected, totally worth the wait in line, and a great way to end the night. The other flavor we tried was the Chocolate Dipped (when in reality we asked for Chocolate Chip, but no complaints there). The ricotta creamy cheese filling was the perfect texture for the Pistachio trimmings, crunchy crispy deep-fried shell, and powdered sugar.

First, it is incredibly crowded and the line is long. Fret not however, the numerous staff ensures that the line is moving at a fast pace so you don't have to worry about being stuck in a time freeze in a crowded line.

Second, my girlfriend and I agree that chocolate chip cannolis were the best tasting cannolis there. Others were still good however.

Third, my girlfriend warns that the pastries overall are extremely sweet so it may not be as scrumptious for those who can't bear excessively sweet food. I, on the other hand, loved it.

I LOVE cannoli, but Mike's seems to offer a more supermarket-style variety of pastry. Way way way too sweet. I was so excited to get one, but I wish I hadn't. Maybe it didn't ruin my day, but it certainly ruined that hour. So sad.

I should have known when I was waiting in line... I had a bad feeling because I saw the cakes in the cases, and their frosting was stark white with brightly colored accents... What this means is that they don't use real butter. If you make real buttercream, it'll always be just almost-white and when you add food-coloring you'll be able to get pastel colors. If you want white and bright colors, you have to use vegetable shortening (ahem, Crisco). This is all fine, but it's not what you expect from an Italian bakery. Come on guys, you have enough business that you can spend a little more on ingredients, can't you? Am I just a snob?

But back to the cannoli. So sweet. Inedibly so. I think most cannoli recipes have you put vanilla or lemon rind in the ricotta cream to give it a bit more depth, but these just seemed to be straight-up sweetened ricotta. And THEN they put more sugar on top. I should have known to say I didn't want it, but oh well.

As we were walking around Hanover, we noticed smal white boxes, but wondered what everyone was carrying.  It was like each block had 3 boxes.  So as we got a closer look, we found Mike Pastrys.....and then our curiosity got the best of us.  We searched our phones, read the reviews and followed the 4 people in front of us claiming they know where Mike's Pastry's was...and there we found it.  A large shop with hundreds of pastries and long stretches of lines.  True, it isn't as friendly and face to face with the customers as Modern is, but they do pump out them mean conollis like hot cakes.  

We ended up spending $28 there for the 3 of us....WHAT normal person spends $28 on pastries for a presnack to dinner?

I happily tried to eavesdrop (with my 6 months of Italian class skills) as one of the ladies switched out of her Boston drawl to hold a conversation in fluent Italian with a tourist from Italy. What a North End moment.
Just a few two-seater tables packed into one corner, but there was table service during breakfast, which surprised me. I don't recall if this is the case at all hours. And despite the disposable plates & utensils, they also bus tables.

No, most of those people don't actually live in Boston.  This is a place for the tourists.  Tourists LOVE it.  Don't believe me?  Ask any of the 30 or so waiting in line at any given moment.  

Don't get me wrong.  The cannolis are good.  Mike's was actually the first cannoli I ever tasted, as part of a purely selfless cannoli tasting experiment I undertook on behalf of my friends.  With no basis of comparison, I loved it.  However, the cannolis at Modern Pastry (down the street a little) or at Maria's (around the block) are much better.  Mike's pre-fills the cannolis, so they aren't fresh.  You really can taste the difference.  The cannolis are also more expensive at Mike's.  It's true that they're also a little bit bigger, but I find that the smaller cannolis actually have a much more pleasing filling-to-shell ratio.  The filling is very sweet, which is good, but it's not as ricotta-y as I might hope a ricotta cannoli will be.

The other pastries are also very good, and here is where Mike's deserves credit.  The selection is amazing - far better than any of the other pastry shops I've been to.  They have everything, including many different varieties of cannoli.  Now, I'm a purist (ricotta filling in plain shell, maybe some chocolate chips on the end), but if you want a peanut shell or something else fancy, Mike's is the place to get it.

But, overall, it's over-crowded, it's not as good as everyone says it is, it's complete chaos inside (it's not really a line, so much as a screaming cluster of people waving cash - much like I imagine the trading floor on Wall Street used to be), and I believe they still only take cash.

I couldn't leave Boston without bringing home some pastries--I really wanted to get my hands on the lobster tail. By now, I was a little sick of anything that had to do with seafood (names, looks, taste), and my stomach did growl by the time I was going to get a ""LOBSTER tail."" Originally, that was the only pastry I intended on getting, but 4 pastries later, I walked out guilty, but happy as hell. 

8 hours later...I was munching on the desserts with my family back home in New York. I'm not the biggest fan of cannolis, but man, were they fried and sweetened to the max. The Limoncello lemon cream was too sweet; I was excited to try this, thinking it would be tart in the slightest, but it was very sweet. The Pecan and Caramel Cannoli was actually much better, and the cream was pretty smooth. I also got a Cream Puff for my mother, who is a huge fan of them, but didn't really enjoy. Finally, the Lobster Tail...I don't get the hype. Maybe it was because my pastries were kept shut in a box for 8 hours in a car, but the cream had a tangy taste to it. It's just a huge breaded pastry with lots of cream. I didn't enjoy it, but I didn't hate it either; there was nothing special about it.

Lining up, we made our way up to the counter and got our respective desserts.  I got the strawberry cannoli, while my colleagues ordered a lemon and chocolate.  Going our separate ways, we all later joined a group text from our respective hotel rooms as we indulged in our selections!  My strawberry cannoli was delectable.

I ran it by Ligaya and she said it was touristy and there were other nearby pastry shops that were excellent and more ""local"". When we got to Hanover Street, we decided to try a cannoli from Mike's and one from Modern Pastry just down the street so we could compare them.

The line at Modern Pastry was so long we decided to split up and I braved the much longer Mike's line. I was scared it'd take a long time, but the one line out the door split into three and once you got to the front counter, you could order from any of the many employees scrambling to fill little paper boxes with delish pastries as fast as they could. If you go to the right, you can order gelato, ice cream or marzipans from the counter there before you even reach the front. The marzipans looked absolutely wonderful. Shiny, miniature fruits that looked real and really yummy.

There were many kinds of cannoli to choose from, the tiramisu looked tempting and I wish I had more time to sample the various cookies and cakes they had on display. I was dedicated to my task, however, got my plain cannoli and managed to get out in pretty good time. There are also tables at Mike's where you can eat your pastry and also get coffee drinks. Even with a long line out the door, there were plenty of tables available, but I couldn't tell if there was table service or not.

By comparison, the Mike's cannoli far outshined the Modern Pastry one. Granted, I'd never had cannoli before but I could easily tell which was better - so this isn't about how good Mike's is in the whole wide world of cannoli, but if these are the two best Boston has to offer, Mike's your guy. The Mike's cannoli pastry was thicker, flakier and more buttery and the filling was slightly sweeter and had a lighter texture than the Modern Pastry. That one's pastry was thinner, not flaky at all and the filling was a little more bland and had the texture of cheesecake rather than pastry filling. You might like that better, but I think Mike's is the way to go on the cannoli. Can't wait to go back and try their other offerings.",fxJcpYyCBgi61PtmlZXTjQ,300 Hanover St,"Candy Stores, Gelato, Food, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Desserts, Patisserie/Cake Shop, Specialty Food, Bakeries, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt",Boston,42.3641813865,-71.0542184385,Mike's Pastry,02113,7298,4.0,MA,1

Why?  Well because I've been touting The North End as the sole trophy winner as far as Italian Neighborhoods in America are concerned, and based purely on urban history and it's current aesthetic, it is.  However, the tacky Italian-American loiterers, the touristy main artery that is Hanover and places like Mike's Pastry are beginning to churn my insides to the bubbly equivalent of Mt. Doom.

Let's see: Mike's Pastry.  Long Lines...always packed...Italian Pastries and Gelatto.  We had a Pistachio Cannoli guaranteed as being freshly made.  Let's think about this here for a minute Ted, why would anybody put a guarantee on a box.  Hey, the way I see it, a guy puts a fancy guarantee on a box cause he wants ya to feel all warm and toasty inside am I right Ted?  Hey, you want me to take a dump in a box and mark it a CANNOLI, I will...I've been to Mike's Pastry!

Two things (modified Tommy Boy monologues aside): 1-Fresh Cannoli's can be determined by the fact that the creme filling is inserted upon ordering, right before consumed....these were not.  2-Fresh Cannoli's usually have a fresh dough (Fresh: warm crispy and chewy and baked goodness flavor)...these were not.

Rather they were stale and poorly made.  I won't even mention the specifics of the cannolis I have had in Italy, but lets just say there are much better ones to be had Italy and US.  

The Gelatto, and I don't even know why I'm doing this, was maybe the worst I've had.  The Lemon was blocks of ice....I was like those frozen lemonades that you get at theme parks that come in the cardboard cups with the wooden tongue dispenser spoons.  We also asked for Cantaloupe and they gave us Watermelon which didn't taste like Watermelon at all and was perhaps the exact opposite texture as the Lemon...instead of blocks of ice...it was basically melted upon arrival.

As I always say, people love to be a part of something....the trouble is, sometime it matters not to people whether that something is good or not.  A friend once made fun of me for wearing a pair of Crocs.  As sickening as the epidempic of the human race to be a part of something en vogue is, when something is good value + good function + good quality, who cares?  Mike's isn't.

I was waiting for the lobster tail to impress me beyond belief. I held the precious $10 Mike's pastry box with only two pastries in it and excitedly headed back to enjoy. The lobster tail was fried and extremely hard. IT was filled with cream that was neither sweet nor flavorful. It was not life changing, so whoever review that I don't know what you would consider life changing ...

The cannolli, maybe I just don't like hard pastries but honestly the shell was hard, the insides were filled with the same bland cream as the lobster tail and the amaretto was barely in existent after the first bite.

I was obsessed all the next day -  planning my return for that evening. I ordered two golds (fat girls rule) and one florentine cannoli just to, order a cannoli, I guess (even though I don't really like them). 

The cupcakes, again, were fabulous. Perfect frosting-cupcake ratio. The cannoli was yucky - that's an opinion thing (well, duh) because I just don't like cannoli but I was interested in the florentine cookie part. I tossed the whole thing.

I got the chocolate mousse cannoli, which surprisingly wasn't too sweet for me. Usually I'm not a fan of the filling, but it was a nice balance to the crispy hard shell. My friend got a lobster tail. I thought it was good, but not as good as my cannoli.

The reason for that is that you should decide really quickly what to order when you finally reached the person behind the counter. 

As the cannoli looked quite small to me and I wanted to try different flavours I took four of them in total, pistacchio, limoncello, chocolate chip, and pecan caramel.

Place gets jammed full of people, and the organization doesn't seem to be there, yet it all somehow comes together.  Take that time while you're waiting to really be sure of what you want, as there is a vast variety of flavors and options.

As for those cannolis, those should be eaten the same day they're purchased--while the shell is still firm and the filling still soft.  The next day, the discrepancy between those textures is diminished, and while still tasty, the spirit is lost.
The other pastries are obviously best the same day, but they seem to last better a few days out if you'd rather grab a box and take it with you.

A snippet from the review is here: Mike's cannoli is significantly larger in size than Modern's, and has more cream inside the shell, but the appeal factor was more for Modern's. Modern's cannoli looks more rustic and homemade, and is crispier than Mike's. While presentation does matter when it comes to food, it all comes down to what it tastes like! Both cannolis were extremely fresh, but the cream in Modern's was softer, creamier, and sweeter. It didn't take us long to determine that Modern has the superior cannoli. Perfect crispy shell stuffed with creamy ricotta. Simply delicious!

Here in Boston, it is no different. I was very eager to try out the desserts and pastries here since there are decent reviews here on Yelp and the photos of the food here looked delectable. 

Like every hyped venue, my party and I were greeted with a long line out the door. It took about 10 minutes just to order. I settled for several cannolis and a lobster tail since these seem to be the hot-sellers here. Upon first bite, I noticed that the cannoli tasted a bit stale. Maybe I received a bad batch of cannolis or they all just taste stale here. Who knows? I wasn't a big fan of the cannolis here.

I did however look forward to trying out the lobster tail because it was humongous and filled with cream. Overall, it was slightly better than the cannoli in my opinion, but it still didn't justify the 10 minute wait. The lobster tail was a bit on the hard side as I had quite a difficult time eating it.

As an avid foodie, this place has been on my list for a while. When I was visiting my friend this weekend in Southie, I got my chance!!

As you walk towards the North End of Boston (aka the ""Little Italy"" of the city, but don't try to call it that), you are greeted with the intoxicating aroma of starch - what I can only assume is homemade pasta in the making. Mike's Pastry is on the left side of the street, right past Modern Pastry on the right (also on my list...maybe next time). 

Both places had lines out the door. Although I cannot speak for Modern, Mike's line moved pretty quickly. Once we were inside, pictures of each of their cannolis and their names were on the wall, giving me more time to debate which one to choose from before reaching the counter. 

There were many employees behind the counter, making it easy to make my way through the throng of people to find someone. The staff is you classic Italian family  - the woman who got my cannolis cracked me up as she was telling me about her daughters (who also work there) and their boy problems. It reminded me of my own family!

I ordered the Amaretto cannoli for myself and took home three for my family: the peanut butter, the espresso, and the chocolate chip. I got them all with powdered sugar (sugar on top of sugar? I think YES!!).

The Amaretto barely made it out of the store. As soon as I got outside, I began to devour. The cannoli was HUGE and LOADED with ricotta. The filling in this one tasted like it was infused with amaretto, giving it a nutty and distinct taste that I found delicious. The shell was soft and crunchy at the same time, and I loved the hint of chocolate from the drizzle. 

My friend likes their lobster claws, which are apparently pretty popular here. I tried some of hers (which was also GIGANTIC), and it reminded me of a cream puff - flaky, doughy pastry with a sweet cream filling. Verrrry delicious and light!

Mike's definitely lived up to my expectations, which were pretty high.

There was a lot of desserts besides cannolis, such as cookies and cakes. I decided to get a strawberry and a Oreo cannoli. They were chilling in the fridge, so they weren't freshly piped, but it was still good! After awhile though, it was a little too much so I shared it with my boyfriend.

To kill time my friend asked me if I like cannoli in which I said, ""nah not my type of dessert."" I have tried cannolis in various restaurants and even homemade ones and still I am I always ."" It's alright"". My friend insisted I try Mikes pastry. I gave in since the wedding wasn't until a few more hours. We walked around Little Italy and as we enter the store my friend asks me if I have cash because she doesn't... I was like why?... yup you guessed it, it's a cash only bakery. The line was almost out the door and seats were very limited but the line goes by fast. There were so many  different flavor... too many choices equals a confused child. We decided on getting four different flavors: original, pistachio, lemon, amaretto with nuts.

Hands down THE best I ever eaten. I loved the original and amaretto... pistachio came in close or almost tied with the original and my least favorite was the lemon filling. They were not too sweet, full of flavor and they are huge! After a few bites I was craving for more but I was already full. I brought my leftovers to California.. hand carried it through tsa, layovers and connections, I had a lot of comments, some even tried to ask them from me.   When I got home it was time to see if the cannolis withstood the trials of travel... The shell was still crunchy after 24 hours and the filling was just as delicious as it came out from the bakery.

Make sure to ask for the powdered sugar on top.  I like this one most, probably because you are still able to taste the full flavor of the cream and the sweetness of the shell, unlike with that of others which often over power the main ricotta filling.. Also, according to my family, the chocolate fudge brownie and assorted bakery cookies are pretty yummy,despite hearing that Modern actually wins with all desserts, excluding cannolis of course.

There's always- i repeat, always- a line out the door for this place.
When you get in there, there's no order. People are just screaming their orders out and shaking their money toward the clerks behind the counters.
It reminds me so, so, SO much of all those 80s movies you see of stockbrokers screaming in the bull pen. 
Back to Mike's-
there's this really neat pulley system built into the cieling that feeds the clerks string so they can wrap the boxes. Seriously, I'm blown away every time- their hands move at sonic speeds, you guys.
The pastries themselves were pretty good, SUPER sweet cannolis, good biscotti, and I'm in love with their giant selection of marzipan goodies. The puffy pastry thing- is it called a lobster tail?- was divine and made with real, heavy whipped cream. I love few things more than getting a few goodies and sitting on a bench with friends and wasting an hour or two people watching.
Definitely worth checking out if you're in Boston.

Note: Please do not be crazy like me and attempt this as a solo traveler. My stomach felt bad afterwards due to sugar overload (but #yolo)

For Mike's, I saw many reviews saying to get the Florentine since it has a different shell so I got it. I think the regular shell would've been better because the Florentine was just too sweet for me. The chocolate chips on the Florentine was also too much for me. But that's an easy fix since you can scrap it off. However, I'd suggest just ordering a different cannoli. 

Comparing the cannoli filling with Modern, they were similar in taste and sweetness level. But the one that I prefer the best is Modern simply because they have the option for mini cannolis and you can customize your topping/filling. And since it's mini, you can have more than one cannoli! Also, if you're worried about it being too cheesey, it's not! Personally, I am not that big of a cheese fan so I was worried that the filling would be too much so I played it safe with one custard cannoli but the ricotta was fine!! (It's more like a thick cream taste than something strong like cream cheese.) 

I also got a sfgotille at Mike's and I would recommend skipping this one. I'm not sure how the pastry should be but the outer pastry was hard and not flaky/crispy like I was expecting. Filling was also meh. I took a couple bites and just tossed it. Also if you are wondering between the difference between the sfogliatelle and the lobster tail, the sfogliatelle is smaller and has a baked filling. The lobster tail has a cream+ricotta filling says the employee. 

At Bova's, I got a mini lobster roll as well and it also had a hard outside so I'm not sure if that's just how it's suppose to be. I got a cappuccino cannoli at Bova's and the ricotta filling itself was too sweet so I'd just stick with Mike's or Modern.

Unfortunately I was not impressed and it did not change my life like most people claim. Now don't get me wrong it was not bad but it was just ok. 

This place is located in North End smack in the middle of Little Italy. It has all kinds of pastries, cookies, sweets, cofee etc... They have a solid wrap around counter that probably has about 8 ladies taking orders at one time. This is a pretty big pastry shop. Maybe it was just me but the ladies behind the counter weren't all that nice.

Of course I ordered a cannoli ;) I was adventurous and got their cannoli florentine...I wish I could take it back, it was way too sweet. The shell was so sweet I could not have more then two bites of it, I ate the filling with a spoon. The filling itself was nothing special but good.

We also ordered a Sfogliatella  which was baked that day so it was fresh. They did a great job baking this it wasn't overly hard on the outside and nice and soft on the inside.

We also ordered coffee which was standard.
Overall for me it was just a normal pastry shop, nothing special and nothing I ate would make me go back especially when you have so many other pastry shops around the corner.

My sister, who lives in the area, and Yelp both suggested Mike's Pastry as a place worth paying a visit.  I'm not big on many pastries, but I succumbed. I felt that I just couldn't be in the North End of Boston without sampling some of the famous pastries. When we walked in, we were overwhelmed. There were people taking pictures of the vast selection of pastries. There were tourists getting their pictures taken in front of the vast selection of pastries. I may or may not have given in and done the same. It wasn't terribly crowded at 6 PM on a Saturday, which surprised me; I was expecting a long line.

The way it's set up is you walk up to any of the many people behind the counter. You say what you want. You give them cash (it's cash only). They package up your sweet goodness into a box and use string/twine from these globes hanging from the ceiling to securely wrap up your delicious pastry present. After some hemming and hawing, I decided on the mint chocolate chip cannoli based on my sister's recommendation. She decided to get the chocolate cheesecake. 

Mint chocolate chip cannoli. Omg. It was heavenly. Also, it was really quite large! It is easy to share (that's what my sister and I ended up doing). The crust is flaky and the filling is what made it really stand out to me. Mint perfection with a very liberal amount of mini chocolate chips smushed onto both ends of the pastry. I felt genuinely sad when I finished eating it. This was the best cannoli I have ever had! On my last day in Boston, I almost took a bus and a train all the way back here just to get more.

Cheesecake. It was really big, which was exciting. However, I was a little bit underwhelmed by the taste. It definitely wasn't bad at all--just average. Maybe I was expecting something outrageously delicious after having had the mint chocolate chip cannoli. 

So, despite the slightly disappointing cheesecake and the fact that it's cash only, the amazing cannoli I had keeps this place at five stars.

Their tiramisu is a little bit of a let down. It's not real tiramisu. It's layer cake tiramisu, if that makes sense. And the taste itself isn't that much better than any other tiramisu we've tried. Go to Giacomo the Italian restaurant and they have way better tiramisu!

There was something weirdly whipped about the cream which, aside from the saccharine taste, was sitting in a dense exterior that had already moistened and lost its flake. 

Lest anyone forget the primary flavor in this classic dessert should be CHEESE. Cannoli are supposed to have a rich yet refined taste and should not be sweet enough to send you into hyperglycemic shock. Bakeries in the USA use cow's milk ricotta and overdo the powdered sugar to thicken it up, leaving little of the ricotta flavor in the process. This creates something that's cloyingly sweet, compared to cannoli filling in Italy where the sheep's milk ricotta is denser and has a bit of tang, allowing it to balance well with any added sugar. Sometimes chocolate morsels are mixed in or there's a candied fruit applied to the outer ends for added flavor and texture. The shell should be thin, light, and flaky, just formidable enough to hold the silky filling within. Shells and filling should be kept separate until an order is placed, ensuring a crunchy outside and a cold smooth inside in every bite. Doesn't that sound great? You won't find any of that here.

All the people raving about how these are the bestest cannoli in the universe have yet to experience the delight and taste of real Italian cannoli. These are sugar, pure and simple, and far from the best dessert you'll find.

The first time we tried, we were thwarted by the usual ridiculous wait for a table.  That turned my wife off to the place so much that it took a long time to convince her to try again.  My sister and brother-in-law's visit was the proverbial straw that broke the camels back.  I wanted them to experience an authentic ""Portland Dining Event"" and this certainly fits the bill.  We were going to go on a Friday night (foolishly).  It was going to be 6 people in our party, so we qualified for making a reservation, which we tried to do that morning and basically got laughed at.  So, we re-scheduled for Sunday.  Got there around 5.45.  The wait for a table for four on the patio was 30-40 minutes.  We opted for the drinks-at-Whiskey-Soda-Lounge option while waiting (I have to say that's pretty convenient!).  When we were called up, we crossed the street just as another group was heading for the hostess hut.  One of the girls in the group broke off and ran past us, thinking she would get on the list ahead of us.  It felt good to just walk right past her, hand the reservation stub to the hostess, and be seated as that group was told they would probably have to wait an hour.  ""Smells like victory.""  

I tell this story in an effort to illustrate what I mean by ""Portland Dining Event"".  Now, on to the food.  I'm not going to spend much time on this because it is thoroughly covered in other reviews.  Instead, just a few bullet-point-style observations.

-Ike's Fish Sauce Wings are a must.  Get them ""spicy"" (unless you're a total weenie) because they taste better that way and aren't actually that spicy, anyway.  These are so fracking good that you are tempted to eat your fingers when you are done due to the sauce sticking to them.  PRO TIP: Order at least 2 portions of sticky rice per order of wings, then pinch off wads of rice to wipe your fingers on and then eat that.  That sauce tastes so damn good, it's a shame to wipe it on a napkin (which doesn't work anyway due to the stickiness).

-The green papaya salad is definitely spicy, but very flavorful.

-The Tamarind Whiskey Sour and the Tamarind Som are perfect for washing down this lovely food.

-Andy Ricker deserves all the praise because this food is phenomenal.",2eLONPkU7pCHfP6MvycOBQ,3226 SE Division St,"Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Pan Asian, Thai, Filipino, Chicken Wings, Vietnamese",Portland,45.504723,-122.63210500000001,Pok Pok,97202,6221,4.0,OR,1

Well I don't care for chicken, but I was in Portland on a foodie trip so I needed to see what all the excitement was about.  I thought it would be sweet since most American Thai restaurants tend to layer on the palm sugar, but I was pleasantly surprised. There a nice balance between the light sticky glaze and the saltiness of the fish sauce. It's not spicy at all, but it's quite satisfying. Besides, I had the papaya salad and it was perfectly seasoned with peppers. Just enough for the that spicy bite, but not overdone to where your lips start burning. They add small dried shrimp to the mix giving the fish sauce somewhat more depth. A bite out of the chicken wing and a bit of jasmine rice then a little pick at the papaya salad --- the contrasting flavors were intense.  

I also had the hang leh which was a braised pork shoulder. It just melted. Each scoop of the nicely thickened broth contained cloves of garlic that seemed to have been roasted then pickled.  Each lite crunch into a clove gave a subtle freshness to the rich pork sauce that I ladled over my rice. Yum. 

I ordered the khao soi chicken for my dinner guest as she didn't care for spicy. It wasn't bad, but it was a bit on the sweet side for me. It does come with lime and hot peppers to adjust the taste to your liking, but I already had enough contrasting flavors going in with the rest of the meal. 

I will return again as the menus has something for all tastes. Sweet, spicy, salty, rich, creamy, crunchy and zesty.

Gave them the cell phone number. Headed down the street to Imperial Taproom for some beers. And guess what, about 90 minutes later, we got the text. Your table is ready. We sat downstairs. There is also an upstairs, a left patio, and a right patio. Oh, and a center patio. Quirky but fun.

Wings are a must. They have been on tv shows and they're spicy and unlike any wing you've had. Just get them. Brussels and pork belly was delicious. Sprouts were perfect, firm consistency. Cha ca catfish was heavenly. Bed of noodles soaked up the sauce nicely. The Neua Naam Tok was amazing. Steak salad. Salad is a loose term and means anything mixed in Thai cooking. No lettuce here. Spicy is misleading. It's hot, but it's so flavorful. Sweat glands, engaged. The complimentary sticky rice comes in handy with this dish. A must.

Here's where I get confused. We sat, ordered, beered up, ate, and paid in probably 40 minutes. Pretty quick turnover. For us to wait as long as we did, that means an army came through while we had beers down the street.

There was a heater above our table, but we still had to wear our down jackets and everyone had very cold legs. 

We got papaya salad, boar collar, chicken wings, catfish, curry noodles, sticky rice and steamed rice. The papaya salad was good. The boar was disappointingly small for $15.50 and it was covered in cilantro - which was too bad because the people who wanted to eat it both dislike cilantro and the menu didn't mention it had cilantro.

The wings seem to be popular with people who like salty foods, but if you're sensitive to salt they may not be for you. I liked the vegetarian curry noodles, but, I wouldn't say they were anything to write home about.

We sat out on a tented, heated patio that was fairly comfortable. The place was busy so we were happy to get what we could.

We got a few things among which most notably was Ike's Wings, I mean with the name similarity how could I not? Plus it was highly recommended by the server for good reason. The wings were big (think two to three American wings to one Ike's wing). The spices and flavoring were delicious and not spicy which was much appreciated by some of the milder palettes of our group. People as far south as Corvallis (an hour away) asked our group if we ate the wings at Pok Pok so they make an impression.

There seemed to be quite a few vegetarian options on the menu. The menu is pretty extensive so it seems that a diverse group should be able to find something to satisfy most (but not a hamburger so don't expect to order from a kids menu for more domestic tastes).",UbN9g9fLZWtPZTm5NxfyEA,3226 SE Division St,"Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Pan Asian, Thai, Filipino, Chicken Wings, Vietnamese",Portland,45.504723,-122.63210500000001,Pok Pok,97202,6221,4.0,OR,1

We walked over here one morning for brunch, and luckily, we were seated right away. After consulting some of my friend's yelps, we decided to go with the boar collar, the curry noodles, and the cha yen. 

The boar collar was SUPER flavorful and VERY spicy (I believe it's a garlic, pepper, lime juice concoction on top). As soon as you bite into it, a rush of flavor smashes into your mouth (first the lime, then the spiciness and other flavors). I knew that my boyfriend would LOVE this dish (because it's spicy), and needless to say, he did! Very small portions though, so beware.

Boy oh boy am I glad we paired it with the curry noodles. It was light, full of coconut milk (as the base probably), and it definitely took the heat off of the boar collar. There was a good amount of chicken, but a small amount of the thick, flat egg noodles. Overall, it was good, but for some reason, I kept on having a bitter aftertaste. This was served with a plate of chili, pickled vegetables, etc. 

The Thai tea with evaporated milk (cha yen) came in a bottle, which was interesting to me. It tasted decent, but it was almost $5, so I am not sure if it was worth it.

All in all, this place is good to try, but keep in mind that it is very pricey for what you end up getting. The waitress recommended at least 3 plates to share between two people, but we wanted to save room for other stuff around the city too.

While many of the dishes are considered ""street food"", or inspired by street food, the prices aren't street.

Those famous fish sauce wings?  $15.50 for 6 of them.

Green papaya salad? $10.

Lastly, and this goes with the first critique, it's crowded and tight. Not alot of elbow room if you were planning on peeling those shrimp or two-handing those chicken wings. It can be pretty cramped.

I stupidly ordered the papaya salad as spicy... and through snot and tears still tried to eat as much as I could. It was so delicious. 

The brussels sprouts were surprisingly good as well, so if you are in a vegetable tasting mood, definitely get that to accompany your meal. 

A few of us also sampled the drinking vinegars which were weird but oddly good. I recommend the Lychee and the cocktail (I forget the name) made with the Clementine Drinking Vinegar. This was like a glorified mimosa with a KICK.. pretty good.

All I can say is that is that we've been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time! My wife had heard that the fish sauce chicken wings were the best in town! I must confess that I was a bit reluctant as I was craving italian and feared the options may be limited as I am of the veggie persuasion and i love options!
Suffice to say, we were very pleased with our meal!!!
I ordered the whiskey flights with the sodas, and boy was I surprised to see how strong they were! They were all local whiskeys and they EVEN had a clear one that tasted like tequila!!1
My wife wasn't drinking so I more than made up for the two of us!
The fresh papaya salad was scrumptious, and the forested mushrooms delectable!
My wife order the steak salad and boy was it spicy! but she absolutely loved it.
she had been craving red meat and it really hit the spot. tender, moist and cooked to perfection.
we split a vegetarian Cow Soi which is a thai noodle soup which was recommended to us by an avid traveler of the Orient who definitely knows what she is talking about.

As for the service our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly a true professional. Even the bussers were courteous and attentive complimenting me on my choice of Thai affigado. I especially liked the remarks as it was a tough decision between that and the thai ice cream sandwich. Our waitress  described the ice cream sandwich as authentic street food AND adventurous which alarmed us. I am so glad that we went with the affigado it was the perfect end to a ABSOLUTELY perfect meal. the sweetened condensed ice cream was luxurious.

I would also like to add that there was only a five minute wait to be seated as I have heard horror stories about long waits to and my husband is very impatient!

I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a Thai meal.

We were so incredibly excited to try this place but, honestly couldn't be more let down. I mean, 1000+ ratings? 4 stars? It had to be awesome right? Nope. Not awesome. Not terrible, either. But, certainly not memorable.

We had the Papaya Salad which, was so so bland..in fact, all their dishes (aside from the Fish Sauce Wings) were desperately lacking salt which, is rare for me to say because my palate often times favor the less salty. It was fresh and a nice balance after half those wings but, mediocre despite the fact that it is apparently one of their best dishes.

Next up, Khao Soi with Chicken. I liked this dish. It was interesting with ample amounts of chicken (dark meat) and the noodles tasted home-made, it was thin and delicate and the crispy noodles on top added a nice crunch. The curry could have used some work though. It had good flavor but, just like the Papaya Salad, it was bland.

I would say, the one dish worth getting is the Fish Sauce Wings though. We had an order of it while waiting for our table at the Whiskey Bar (Also, run my Pok Pok so, they had some of their dishes AND your server at Whiskey Bar will also let you know when your table is ready at Pok Pok since they are partner restaurants which, is pretty smart). For about $12, we got a hefty portion of wings that were delicious! Great dish to start with.

Overall, Pok Pok wasn't awful..but, it wasn't great either. Unfortunately, it did not satisfy my Thai craving but, being as it may be one of the few Thai places in Portland, I guess it'll do.

I knew I had to try Pok Pok after my aunt said it was worth waiting an hour for. Let me give you some background, my aunt doesn't wait for anything! Her favorite restaurant could have a 10 minute wait and she would go elsewhere. She always says, ""I don't live in communist Russia, I shouldn't have to wait for my food"". So when she said that Pok Pok was worth the wait, I planned my trip across Portland immediately. My dad and I came on a Wednesday afternoon. I figured there wouldn't be a wait considering what a strange time it was, but I guess no wait at Pok Pok is unheard of! After about 20 minutes of waiting in the rain we were seated inside. (I'm not exactly sure how the seating works. We sat indoors at a table by the bar but there appeared to be outdoor tents that people were sitting in as well?) I ordered the Vietnamese fish sauce wings as promised and a side of sticky rice. My dad ordered the Kai Yaang which was half of a game hen stuffed with various Thai ingredients. To my surprise, our food came very quickly! But to my dismay, the $3 side of sticky rice was smaller than my palm... I couldn't believe how much they charge for 3 measly bites of rice! But once I bit into the first wing, none of that mattered.. I was in love! The balance of sweet and spicy, the crunchy skin -- they were perfect! I ate every last bite and didn't even mind that my hair and face were completely covered in sauce. My dad agreed that the wings were a true gem. He was less impressed with his dish however.

I chose a busy weekday night (Friday) so I wouldn't have to miss the Warriors NBA Finals game.  Sure enough, I entered my order and within about 45 minutes (the drive alone is 15 minutes), my order was at my doorstep as the game started.  Score!  Our order:

Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - a hearty portion of very large chicken wings arrived still hot and tasty.  The fish sauce is mild flavored and the sauce is sticky, but delicious.  I liked that the wings were meaty and had plenty of tender and well flavored dark meat.  It was served with a side of pickled vegetables and lettuce leaves.  Very good, though I'd give the nod to San Tung chicken wings in SF being more addicting.

Kai Yang - the rotisserie chicken was a whole chicken/hen order nicely separated and cut out.  It was moist, warm, and juicy, especially the dark meat.  Skin was flavorful and delicious.  Some pieces of the white meat were a bit dry, but helped tremendously by the two sauce containers included, one a spicy sweet and sour and the other a green tamarind sauce.

Overall, we couldn't have been more thrilled to try Pok Pok.  Both dishes were filling and hearty and as good as I would have expected.  The drinking vinegars were more novel than anything.  I suspect the food would have been even better at the restaurant and with even more dishes, but this was a great taste of Pok Pok and it couldn't have paired better with a Warriors Game 4 win.

So why 3 stars? Well, the portion of the dishes are small. It's good to be small as the standard American-size dish probably contributed to the obesity epidemic.

You won't find any Pad Thai or chicken satay here.  In fact, unless you are Thai, you probably won't find anything here that you've had before.  The menu is long - however, the number of items is actually not that long, but the descriptions are very long.  How to make roast chicken sound sexy and justify a $14 price for a half-bird? - call it Kai Yaang and list all the things that go into the Pok Pok (a Thai mortar and pestle) in 37 words.  Yikes!  That being said, the roast chicken was tasty.

Kaeng Hang Leg, pork belly and shoulder in curry sauce was tasty but the portion was super small.  Muu Papa Kham Waan, or grilled boar collar wrapped in mustard green, was also a tiny portion, and overly salted.  Cha ca ""La Vong,"" by the way, not a MMA fighter's name, is marinated catfish fried in tumeric oil.  Tasty but truly a flyweight portion size.

The Papaya Pok Pok, a spicy green papaya salad, is very spicy and also quite tasty in a masochistic sort of way.  Northern Thai curry noodles, Khao Soi, is pretty good too, and appreciably mild.  The chicken wings, a specialty of the house, called Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings, are fried and coated with caramelized fish sauce; they're sticky and funky, a little spicy, but were a bit dry and could have been meatier.

The beverage program is distinctive.  They are known for having great beverages, alcoholic and non-alcoholic, including drinking vinegars and locally brewed Thai ice teas.

I ordered their fish sauce chili wings for which they are known for and got myself a mango cocktail. I'm extra judgey on their wings because I myself am Vietnamese American and I've tasted a fair amount of fish sauce wings.

My first impression of the wings was that it was not too spicy which was fine with me, the server said it would be less than Siracha level spicy. The wings weren't as crispy as I would have liked, more on the soft side which is ok too, some people like that. However the deal breaker for me was the taste of the wings - it was too salty. Fish sauce is hard to cook with and if not balanced correctly, it can overwhelming be incredibly salty which it was. What's also weird would I get some chili bites in between so the sauce didn't seem evenly distributed. I finished the water pitcher they gave me by myself and downed my alcohol drinks. The only reason why this review gets an extra star is that the bartender who helped me was very attentive, making sure I had a pleasant dining experience, and made sure I enjoyed the drinks he made. Despite quality service, I was so disappointed in the wings and am shocked it is their best and most popular item on the menu.

Kai Yaang (Thai style grilled chicken) - chicken was tender but was so so. you should eat this with spicy sauce or sweet sauce.

Muu(Pork) Satay - i'm glad that they had Muu Satay like in Thailand. wonder why they have chicken satay instead of pork in most of Thai rest here in US. one word, too much coconut milk.

Som Tum(Papaya salad) - i don't like it. only sour. no sweet, no salty, no spicy. and Khao Man(Coconut rice) - so so.

Khao Soi Chicken(Northern style egg noodle with curry soup) - chicken was tender and curry was good. well seasoning.

Shrimp chips - this is what i liked the most fr. Pok Pok. really can't stop eating this. crunchy and tasty.

The restaurant is in a residential neighborhood, but there are a bunch of small restaurants and bars along the way. We got there early enough for lunch so it wasn't crazy busy and it was easy to find street parking. 

The hostess was great at welcoming us and asked if we wanted a table outside with heaters or inside the dining room. We told her we will take whatever is available so we sat inside right next to the bar. 

We weren't asked what we wanted to drink right away. Our waiter first came by after about 5 minutes so by that time we we already knew what we wanted order. 

There was just something strange about our waiter. After we ordered, he would just pause and then start talking. He did this the whole time which made it very awkward. Just very strange behavior from him. 

Anyway, we ordered the fish sauce chicken wings and Pok Pok special which included half of a game hen, papaya salad and sticky rice. The chicken wings are on the saltier side so definitely eat this with rice. The game hen was perfectly cooked. So tender and juicy and the plum sauce that came with it was delicious. The papaya salad wasn't all that great, though. It was on the plain side and not spicy enough even though we asked for it to be spicy.

This particularly dangerous technique, made famous by then-Cowboy safety Roy Williams, involves grabbing an opposing ball carrier by the inside of their shoulder pads and dragging him to the ground from behind. The tackle puts the ball carrier in an awkward position that is likely to cause knee or ankle injuries.

I am currently developing a technique called the ""boar collar tackle"" that is similarly violent and dangerous. It will be used as a deterrent to anyone who touches or longingly glances at my Muu Paa Kham Waan plate. The staff at Pok Pok will tell you that their dishes are meant to be shared, but I have trouble believing it on this one.


I had been wanting to check out this lauded establishment for quite some time, but my wife is rarely in the mood for Thai food (a tragedy) and the lines at Pok Pok always seem to be a deterrent. I lucked out this past Friday night when the wife brought Pok Pok up by name and the wait was less than 10 minutes for dinner.

We had agreed to sit anywhere they could put us, but we got a great seat on the porch of the house with a nice view of the street below. Our table had a bottle of rice water (that's right, rice... not ice) which was actually a nice compliment to the meal. After quite a bit of deliberation, she went with the baked prawns with pork belly, I had the boar collar with a side of rice, and we decided to share the famous fish sauce wings.

There was nothing subpar on the table... not even close. The flavors are all so unique, but it was really the boar collar that jumped out and stole the show. The wings were nice, a little sweet, but not the earth-shattering experience that has been described. I wish I had seen Don B.'s advice to have them spiced up a little. I didn't taste the prawns, but had some pork belly with noodles. This was also tasty, but not something that you slowly savored every bite like the boar collar. It comes medium spicy, by my calibrated pallet, with a side of greens to cleanse said pallet.

The service was friendly and very attentive once we had ordered. The variety on the menu definitely leaves room for another visit, but the prices are a little steep compared to other Thai offerings ($2 for a couple ounces of rice to go with my $12 entree). We'll probably be back for a special occasion or with visitors, but the prices might keep Pok Pok out of our regular rotation.

They have a pretty legit bar and interesting drinks with lots of drinking vinegars. None of them were too sweet or tiki-ish.
- Tamarind whisky sour: interesting with the tamarind
- Hunny: well balanced, lots of citrus juice, not too sweet 
- Heat Ray: a bit spicy, with celery drinking vinegar which was really interesting and good
- Lord Bergamot: one of the best tea based cocktails I've had, and it had a honey drinking vinegar 

Food: I wish we had more people so that we could order more to share.
- Phak kuut Ko: fiddlehead fern salad with naam phrik. The salad was warm with tons of flavors and textures, and the fiddle heads were cooked perfectly  
- Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings: their most popular dish. The wings were pretty good and had a good amount of meat, and the flavor was so rich and good (sweet and savory, not too fishy). It's probably the best marinade I've had on any wings 
- Yam Wun Sen Chao Wang: glass noodle salad served warm, with lots of different proteins in it (mussels, ground pork, Chinese sausage). This was good, but then when I saw the table next to us with a clay pot with noodles, I wished I had gotten that (it looked so good)
 
I feel like any Thai place without pad Thai on the menu is legit. Their stuff has lots of complex flavors and is a lot more interesting than the standard Thai menu. It's definitely worth venturing out to the SE side to try Pok Pok.

It was incredible and unique and even though I am a pansy when it comes to tolerating spicy stuff, I couldn't keep away from the then-punishing papaya salad. (It has since mostly slipped into a friendlier, compromised version of its former self, possibly because other pansies are whinier than me.)

Anyway, I also have bragging rights to having dined inside the night it opened, before people wearing golf shirts from Lake Oswego started showing up. It is truly depressing to be deprived of the full menu there - the take-out window (with its painfully small selection) is a 2-3x/mo gig for us because we have a toddler - where the decor is oddly cool and the steak salad sings with delicious pungent spices and the wings are so addictive that one could almost cry for them.

I was searching for it on the plane and mentioned this place to my buddy. Just as I mentioned Pok Pok, the random stranger (Drew, who lives in Portland) sitting next to me said this is a place I gotta try. It's very well known / renowned in Portland. 

We came here on a Thursday afternoon for lunch, so we didn't see any of the log lines or crowds mentioned in other reviews. We sat inside which was a very good decision...since it must have been 90 outside. 

I can't speak for the authenticity of the food. Seems more like a Asian fusion that works very well. 

For starters we ordered the Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce wings. Everybody seems to be raving about these...with good reason! Delicious! Tons of flavor, just the right mix of sweet, spicy & tangy. I'm a big fan...it would take a long while to get sick of these.

I got the Muu Paa Kham Waan (Boar collar). SPICY! Tender meat with tons of flavor and spices. I'm sure it's probably not spicy enough for true spicy lovers, but it definitely gave me the spice sweats. The dish came with a side of mustard greens on ice to cool you down. BRILLIANT! Lets just say I used all the greens...

My buddy got Pok Pok special. Good healthy size dish. The game hen was delicious...just done perfectly! The dipping sauces had good flavor, not overpowering at all. The salad was nothing special, but definitely edible. 

The biggest disappointment here was the sticky rice. Its hard and dry, like it was made in big batches and was sitting around for a while. I usually love sticky rice, one of my favorite things to eat while in Thailand. I would definitely pass on this one...

1. Khanom Jiin Sao Naam (Coconut Ginger Pineapple Vermicelli): My favorite of our lunch due to the nice sweet to savory balance of the flavors. Make sure you're open to all the ingredients before trying, as that should be a prerequisite for enjoyment.

2. Khao Soi Chicken (Curry Noodle Soup): Very simple, but tastes homey and very in tune with a comfort soup dish vibe.

3. Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings: A bit overrated, but you should try it anyways, at least once. I suggest sharing, as it could get a bit heavy after a couple wings.

When you say to someone ""we're going for Thai food,"" they're probably imagining the ubiquitous pad thai. The green and red curries dotting the menu like Christmas decorations. All dialed into that American palette with a sickly sweetness.

Not at Pok Pok. Unless you've been eating food from street vendors in Northern Thailand, most of this menu is probably little more than an incomprehensible list of Romanized Thai words with weird descriptions of ""pork belly"" and ""duck leg"" and... and... and... 

So, what I'm saying is this: set your expectations aside for an evening and step up to some flavor, for once.

True, Pok Pok empresario Andy Ricker is building a nationwide empire on his chicken wings. And you should order the chicken wings. They are sublime. Though if all you want are the wings, you can get them at the Whiskey Soda Lounge across the street and not have to wait 90 minutes for the privilege, or next time you're at PDX, grab them from the food cart before security.

So, maybe when you put your name in here for a table and they tell you it's going to be an hour and a half, you head to Whiskey Soda and order the wings for a preview of what's to come. That's a good strategy. 

But then, when you finally get your table, look at the menu and pick some things that sound unusual. Even scary (there's nothing all that scary on this menu, but to the uninitiated it can be a bit intimidating). The Neua Nom Tok (spicy flank steak) is crazy delicious. The Khao Soi (curry noodle soup) is completely out of control. The Kaeng Hang Leh (sweet pork belly) will, in all likelihood, blow your mind. And that's just scratching the surface.

The surprising and delightful flavors just keep coming. And, yes, it's a long wait. And yes, it's got all of the hype that Portland has to give. But sometimes, every once in a while, the hive mind gets it right.

The flavors weren't the typical southeastern asian affair, and even though I'm not too experienced with food of that reason, there was definitely an inimitable authenticity to the food served here. 

The chicken wings, the signature favorite of Pok Pok, lived up to its name, contrasting the juicy, tender chicken with a crispy outer coat, with a sprinkling of chopped peanuts over the crispy intensely colored skin. The flavor bombs were dynamic, with a punch of sourness, then a kick of spice, and bringing it together was an overwhelmingly good savory flavor. 

Be warned despite the spiciness of the chicken wings, it was probably the least spicy part of the menu we ordered from. Pok Pok doesn't back down, it continues to throw its punches at you with a diverse array of flavors, with one similarity, a spiciness that only the brave can handle. (note to all* order the Thai iced tea to help balance out the flavors).

Papaya Salad - they said it was spicy but i didn't think it was unmanageable, just a tiny kick. Really yummy, but i generally like papaya salad anyway

Pok pok special - my favorite item for the night. Super tender and wonderfully spiced skin. 

Hui thawt - the crepe!!!! Omgomg..a lot friends said this was their fave,  but i thought my piece was a little bit salty. Its super crispy and fluffy

Boar collar  - this was a spicy dish, but really flavorful and its great with sticky rice!

The wings were good, but could have used more salt. It reminded me of Korean fried chicken - deep fried wings covered in sauce. The papaya salad had a pleasant spicy kick.

First off the location, ambiance and vibe was all amazing and just as I thought it would be. Very Thailand, and most importantly very much lived up to my high expectations.

Food: 

Pok pok special (5 stars): there's no reason not to get this. The signature papaya salad is a must and the sticky rice is incredible. The chicken was so juicy and everything went together so well. I cleaned the plate on this gigantic order of food easily bc it was so great tasting. 

Boars collar (5 stars): super spicy and juicy and delicious! I didn't know what we were expecting when we ordered this but definitely wasn't what we got. I thought it was gonna be dry and gamey, but nope! This is a must order item in my book. 

Ike's fish sauce wings (5 stars): goodness it's just not fair that I can't get these everyday. They are incredible!! The crispy garlic and sticky coating is amazing. I've tried to make these at home and they haven't come out quite the same. These wings are addictive!

It was a bit confusing as we literally had 2 waiters come by to tell us the exact same thing and take our orders. It happens. servers were nice and the food came out fast for the most part. the highlight is def the chicken wings, get it with some heat, the mild ones are too restraint and you do not get the full flavor. i love the chicken wings, just don't love the price especially if you are coming from an Asian town like SGV in LA, California. the price is a bit inflated for value but i get it's a novelty out here.

I was fairly disappointed to see Pok Pok pull every one out of the book, but also sacrifice the experience. 

Our server did not know what to recommend and provided little to no guidance on the menu. They served a side salad with one of the meat dishes that was a chunk of red cabbage with core intact, and a few branches of mint and rotting pea shoots. You'd think a $15 dish would at least offer sliced cabbage. Ordered a Tsing Tao which ran a cool +$5, which I don't think I've ever paid more than $3 for. You don't pay microbrewery prices on Bud Light quality beer. Ordered a side of sticky rice, which was a cup of sticky rice in a plastic bag served in a bamboo cup. The sticky rice is pre-packaged in plastic bags and kept warm in a rice cooker next to the bathroom, next to about a few dozen other bags. The rice was very dry despite being in bags, which makes me wonder how long those bags have been sitting in the cooker for. The Ike's chicken wings were good, but as other customers have described, were very sweet and slightly undercooked.

I can see why Pok Pok is closing down their LA location. It's honestly strange the NY branch got a Michelin star - I wonder what they do differently out there.

The spicy chicken was good but slightly under cook since I saw blood on my wings. The Laap Pet Isaan was ok, definitely spicy. I thought the duck liver and etc was too finely chopped to taste the full flavors of it. All I could taste was the lemongrass and spicy chilies. I didn't quite get the plate of veggies that came with it. Probably would have been better if I got rice papers to make spring rolls out of it. Kaeng hung leh was good. Can taste the coconut curry flavors, more of a brothy dish with minimal pork belly, almost was like soup. Only got one pork while the other was basically a cube of fat.

What I can say is that I have been to Pok Pok several times and have yet to be disappointed. My last visit I took some Pok Pok virgin friends along with my husband and toddler. We made a reservation the same day and all they had available was rather late, but they did fit us in at the end of the night. 

The food is detailed and interesting. Several times our conversation turned to the food because it begged to be talked about. I highly recommend the sticky rice and if you are a nerd like me, you'll want to eat everything with your fingers.

Our server (who I'll refer to as ""asian glasses guy"" ;) was great in helping us choose menu items, he made us feel welcome adjusting for our toddlers tastes and wiggles, and didn't put any pressure on us to leave even long after they had closed. He even recommended some other great restaurants for us to check out in our other food pursuits.

My friends raved at the quality and flavor of the food and everyone left with a nice warm heat on our tongues and full bellies.

Fun cocktail list. I've heard the drinking vinegars are really good--one of them has made it into a cocktail (raspberry vinegar, soda and... was it gin?) but I was lured by the home-made bitters in the tamarind whiskey sour.

Portions... not as big as you'd like.

Menu... almost nothing in common with other Thai restaurants--a nice departure.

Food... intensely seasoned. Sometimes kinda hot, and often on the salty side, to my taste. I LOVE the stringy slow-cooked pork with coconut rice. The pork / pork belly curry was rich, decadent and delicious--and not like other curries. The seafood curry was very brothy, very tasty--a generous amount of shellfish swimming around in there....

The traditionally steamed sticky rice, wrapped in plastic wrap & tucked in a little woven basket: hhmmnnnnn, I'm not sure about heating up plastic wrap on my food. Has plastic wrap got the Bad Stuff in it? Gotta look into that....

Dessert--we shared the ice cream sandwich: 2 or 3 scoops of Coconut Jackfruit ice cream served in a regular bun, rather like a hot dog bun. With sticky rice. Chocolate sauce. Grated coconut too, I think. According to the menu, this is ubiquitous from street vendors in Thailand. Well. I prefer my ice cream without bread, it turns out. 

We were an unwieldy group of 10. They squeezed us next to another table that was not so happy to see us come & take over--It was tighter than an airline seat for a few folks at their table & ours, until we succeeded in running them out of the joint....

Even though Pok Pok just opened a NY location, I needed to try the original and see what all the hype was about. We got there around 1pm on a Saturday afternoon and only had to wait about 10 minutes. For such a popular place, this was already a win in my book.

Another win was the fish sauce wings, ordered spicy. They were lathered in an almost Korean-style wet sauce with spices and red chili flakes. The meat was tender and juicy in their slightly crispy outer skin. Unfortunately, this was the only real high point for me.

The charcoal rotisserie roasted game hen was good but not enough to impress. The marinade added a lot of different flavors to the subtly smokey meat. However, the meat could have been juicier; and whenever there are extra dipping sauces on the side, I feel like it takes away from true taste of the meat. Good meat and seasoning should be able to stand by themselves.

Everything else we tried was just OK. The grilled boar collar had a citrus-y garnish. The grilled baby back ribs were small and lacking in meat. They tasted almost exactly like Chinese spare ribs, so there was nothing unique to me about the dish.

I would come back to have some more wings and try some other dishes, but my overall reaction for my first time at Pok Pok was just OK. Until next time.

- ikes vietnamese fish sauce wings: these were incredibly addicting. well spiced, flavorful. the chicken was tender and juicy. the sauce was finger licking good. i cant even describe it. i think i would be willing to visit again and order two plates of this to eat all by myself. 
- muu sateh (pork satay): the pork was tender, the satay sauce peanuty. while very good, it wasnt the most knock your socks off dish. 
- jin hoom neua (beef stew): deep flavor. it tasted like it had been simmering all day. spicy, the kind that hits the back of your throat and makes you pause, but you still feel compelled to take in more spoonfuls. the beef was good, but it was the broth that kept me coming back
- kaeng hung leh (pork belly): this was my second favorite dish of the night (after the wings). i LOVE pork belly. that layer of fat, that tender pork. the flavor was savory, garlicy, i loved the sauce so much i was pouring it over my sticky rice for a flavor bomb boost
- passionfruit drinking vinegar: delicious, refreshing
- sticky rice: good

pros:
- FOOD! if anything, just come for the fish sauce wings. trust me. 
- price: all the dishes were around $12-15. nothing was outrageously expensive, everything was reasonably priced

cons:
- wait: my friends and i were incredibly lucky i think. we went during the week on the early side, and we were able to get a table on the patio. but my friends warned me how long the wait could be for dinner. so bad, that the owner opened up a bar across the street to satiate those who were waiting for table (what a genius idea! getting your customers money twice, once at the bar for beer, once again at the restaurant for dinner!)
- pretentious: our server, while very adept, he wasnt very friendly and had an air of pretension around him. i wish he had smiled every now and again. but honestly, im just being nitpicky at this point. who gives a crap about the pretentious server (it seems like a common theme for most portland servers)? come for the food!

Overall, I was a bit disappointed in the food here, minus the fish sauce chicken wings and sticky rice.

Like everyone says, the fish sauce chicken wings are a MUST.  These chicken drumstick and wing pieces are marinated in fish sauce, deep fried, then coated in more caramelized fish sauce.  You can't go wrong.  It is a little saltier to eat as a stand alone item so it's nice that they provide some light veggies on the side.  I would actually get sticky rice to eat with this as well.  One sticky rice portion is small, literally enough for one person, so get more.

Next up was the Muu Paa Kham Waan which is boar collar meat with an extremely pungent sauce with crushed up goodies on top.  You wrap this in the mustard greens they provide on the side and use the crushed ice to cleanse your palette.  The menu says that this is drinking food so I think beer would've lessened the intensity or made it more eatable.  The meat itself was a little on the tough side and I've noticed this when ordering this dish even at other places.  I won't accept it though; I know they can do better!

Khao Soi is a coconut chicken curry noodle soup but this was the biggest disappointment for me.  The Burmese version is thick and creamy--true comfort food.  This was watery and flavorless.  They do give you a lot of tender chicken pieces but that didn't make up for it.  Also, it needs a lot more of the condiments (lime, chili flakes, shallots, pickled mustard greens) to make up for the lack of flavor.  

Bloody Mary is $9 for a 12 oz. cup, didn't have enough tomato juice, and is on the lighter side.  Not a must get.  I like the hut style restaurant which is nostalgic of some of the indoor/outdoor combo restaurants I've been at in Thailand.

Fish sauce wings are a must! I remember being hesitant on ordering the papaya salad because a. It might be too bland in satisfying this Asian girl's heavy palate or b. it just wouldn't be good (too sweet, sour, fishy...) which is common at Thai places, but I was pleasantly surprised by how refreshing it was. I usually don't use that word when describing papaya salad. I'm Mien (look it up because I know you're wondering) and I love my papaya salad a perfect balance of spicy, fishy, sour, and sometimes crabby and with pahddet (a highly acquired taste).  While this wasn't usually the way I eat my papaya salad it was so damn good. A hint of fish sauce, and a nice balance of sour and spicy. Even my boyfriend loved it! The boar collar is also a must! Really tender and moist. The pepper sauce on it is what makes it though. Perfect with steak or pork and just like at home.

Mmmmmm....Carlton Farms pork loin skewers marinated in coconut milk and turmeric, grilled over charcoal and served with peanut sauce, cucumber relish and grilled bread. Coconut rice. Thai iced tea with lime juice, a refreshing alternative to the milky sweet version at other Thai joints.  

Ike's Vietnamese chicken wings:  My God.  I had to close my eyes while chewing.  I ate each wing slower than the last.  You will want to lick and nibble every morsel of chicken off of each wing, and then you will want to caress each leftover bone.  

If I hadn't had a dinner companion with me I would have taken home the bones, and placed them in a lighted, sealed case on a gold platter, next to my bed.  So that before I closed my eyes at night and when I opened them in the morning I would be gently reminded of the true heaven which is Pok Pok chicken wings.

The pork belly was again good but not for $14.50 for 3-4 small pieces in a claypot consisting of mostly fat.

This is a little hot, but for fans of chicken wings it is a no-brainer. The heat is a savory sweet heat that lingers. The lime and garlic are very present as is the taste of charcoal. The portion was small, but, you won't care, you will be satisfied.

The flavor lingered for almost an hour and I was very grateful that it did.

We also had the curry noodle soup which I found too sweet and not very spicy (they give you some chili paste on the side, but it's not the same). The beef cubes that came in the soup were very tender though, so that's a plus.

Nevertheless, the staff were very attentive and the place was nice. Despite the disappointment I may give them another try since some of the dishes that other tables had looked good.

This is the #1 thing I always need to do when visiting my boyfriend's family in Portland. Always always worth the wait, we usually sit inside downstairs and love the cozy ambiance. So we have only been a few times but here are some of our favorites.
*#1 MUST MUST Try is the fish sauce wings and go spicy! I could eat these morning noon and night but I'd double my weight. Perfect for two to share if they're hungry and ordering a few other dishes. If you do not order these you will stare in vain as they walk by your seat and serve to everyone else.
*Kung Op Wun Sen - which is shrimp and pork belly over glass noodles. I have had many glass noodle dishes in my day but wow there is some great depth of flavor in that sauce! 
*Yam Makheua Yao - if you like smoky flavored eggplant than this is your dish! It gives you an intense (in a good way) smoke straight to your taste buds but then the egg, shrimp and fish sauce quickly take your taste buds to a whole other world. we really liked this dish, taste like nothing I've ever had before.
*Hoi Thawt - basically a omelet with mussels but this is one of my favorites too. Great flavor!

Pok Pok serves one of the TOP 2 WINGS i've had to date!!
---fish sauce wings: each wing comes w/ 3 segments.. crusty, STICKY, & flavorful like wings should be. definitely order them SPICY& pair them w/ a side of sticky rice!
---khao soi kai: curry noodle soup that's yummy! I also enjoyed eating the left over soup with our side of coconut rice. you can choose your meat but we opted for beef 
---Rotisserie hen. Nothing special but seems popular since they limited our ordering to a half hen instead of a whole due to limited quantities
---papaya salad. not as spicy as in Thailand but refreshing!

if you don't like plain water, you're in luck because they serve Pandan flavored water

We decided to risk going without a reservation, and showed up at 5pm on a Saturday.  To our surprise, they were able to seat our party of 6 within 5 minutes or so.

They have a good beer selection.  The cocktails are very good, but on the spendy side; $10 seems kinda steep for a gin and tonic.

The food is excellent.  I had the baby back ribs and sticky rice.  The ribs were very tender and flavorful.  The dipping sauces for the ribs were also excellent.  I'm not sure why they chose to cut the ribs into 1-inch pieces, rather than serving them whole, but perhaps that is the traditional preparation for the dish.  Portions weren't as large as I'm used to, but I got full, and didn't feel cheated.  Prices for food were perfectly reasonable.

The restrooms are inconveniently placed in the building; they are in a very high-traffic area for the waitstaff.  The servers constantly have to ask customers who are in line for the 2 single-person restrooms to get out of the way.

In a world of every Thai restaurant basically offering the same exact menu and nearly the exact same eats, Pok Pok is a breath of fresh air. At most Thai restaurants, you know exactly what to expect. Here at Pok Pok, you're guaranteed to be treated to some tastes that you probably haven't had before.

The food itself isn't exactly just Thai. There's lots of other influences there as well, such as Laos and Vietnamese. But it all comes together so well that you kinda just forget what kind of food you're eaten and just enjoy the food for what it is. Only the best restaurants seem to have that level of appeal, and Pok Pok is right up there with the best.

You gotta have the Fish Sauce Wings here. It's their signature dish for a reason. This is where it gets hard to review food for me, because the taste was so unique that it's almost impossible to describe. The flavor comes at you from almost every angle with these wings. They're sweet and savory and spicy and bitter and sour all at the same time. I don't know how they managed that level of culinary perfection, but mark me a believer in these wings. 

We also ordered the Neua Naam Tok which is pretty much a spicy steak salad with fish sauce. They warn of an intense spice here but even my delicate tongue was able to easily handle it. Lastly we ordered the Muu Paa Kham Waan, and the boar meat just seemed to melt in your mouth. So damn good. My mouth is honestly watering just from writing these past few sentences.

Really my only complaint about the meal is something that these guys have no control over. I wasn't a fan of the Beer Lao. Really did not have a good taste to it at all. I basically just ordered it to say I've tried it, and it'll honestly be the first and last time I ever order it. Not good beer at all.

Loved the chicken wings (pretty sure they were thighs but not complaining!), the papaya salad, the boar...such interesting and flavourful food, what a unique experience.  I love the thai food I get normally but so refreshing to have something new and different!

the CONs - on the way down we sat inside - it is LOUD in there, and tiny, and we really felt crammed and uncomfortable.  The staff were also less than attentive, and it was not busy at the time of day we came in.  They were nice, just not around as much as I would have liked for water, or maybe ordering another menu item or two that I had my eye on!

We had 2 kids with us, who are great in restaurants and adventurous eaters, but maybe they were put off by them, as this doesn't really seem like it's meant to be a kid friendly place.  This may be a PRO for many of you :)

If you are going to go to Pok Pok you have to get the wings.  These things are absolutely out of this world.  Just amazing.  Get them.  You should probably stop reading and do it now.

We have eaten Pok Pok a few times.  Though we have only eaten in the restaurant once.   As everyone has mentioned, the wings are absolutely amazing.  They balance sweet and spice in ways that I did not even know were possible.  But do not be fooled and order the 'spicy' variety of wings.  The house version balances everything perfectly.  The spicy version is good.  In fact, they are very good.  But they are not the best wings you have ever had.  That honor goes to the regular Pok Pok fish sauce wings.  As soon as you try them.

The Boar Collar is another dish that should not be missed here.  When it first came out I was initially disappointed in the serving size.  However, this little dish packs a whole whallop of flavor.  Mix it with some good sticky rice and you are good to go.

The only dish that I did not really care for was the Pok Pok salad.  I just could not taste any flavor through the dense layer of spice.

Pok Pok also makes a mean cocktail.  They have, hands down, the best whiskey sour I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying.  Their whiskey selection is impressive to say the least.   They also have a variety of drinking vinegars for those that do not drink or may happen to be pregnant.  These drinks are so good they almost make up for one not being able to drink alcohol and, therefore, those delicious whiskey sours.  I have never actually seen or heard of drinking vinegars in any other venue.  They were an absolute delight and come highly recommended.

There is really only one thing holding Pok Pok back from getting a 5 star rating.  And that is the wait.  The wait here on a weekend is legendary and absolutely terrible.  Kudos to them for opening the Whiskey Soda Lounge to hold the masses while they are waiting 1 hour + for their table.  But, last time I was in there I realized that the Soda Lounge has all of the best parts of Pok Pok - WITH OUT THE WAIT!  They have the epic wings, full whiskey selection and drinking vinegars.  And, really, i do not need anything else.

One final note - Pok Pok does have a to go window.  You can get your wings on the road in under 10 minutes.  But be careful.

Unfortunately, a 2 hour wait was far too long for me and my friends so we opted to order to-go and found a random outdoor table down the street where we devoured our meal in the cold December air!

Other highlights of our meal included the Boar Collar (that spicy chili/lime/garlic sauce was pure heaven), Papaya Salad (great balance between tart and spice), and the Northern Thai Curry with Chicken (coconut flavor was not overpowering)! The Thai Iced Tea also hit the spot, despite being cold enough to cause all of us the shiver as we ate outside.

This is where they lose cred - this chicken was like warm and the skin was soggy and obviously reheated chicken.  She may have seen him pull left over chicken but this was absolutely not a fresh dish.  

The boar collar was tasty and super hot but you get a nice plate of mustard greens on ice to help.  Also ordered sticky rice which was the driest hardest sticky rice I've ever had - again i think microwaved in a bag.  I love sticky rice - have had it many many places and again just disappointing.

The nice thing was that they have a sister lounge across the street that you can hang out at while you wait. After much discussion about what we wanted to do for two hours, we ended up at Whiskey Soda Lounge. 

At WSL you can actually order some of the menu items from pok pok. We got some drinks and ordered their famous fish sauce wings. When the wings came out, I couldn't help but dig in. They are like heaven on a bone. It was so nice that WSL serves this dish because it was a nice thing to enjoy before you get to eat at Pok pok.

My friend who lives in OR ordered what he knew was good. If you have a friend in OR, then have them help you because it can get overwhelming. The wings were very filling and BIG, so we only ordered two dishes and a side of sticky rice. We got the Neua Naam Tok and Muu Paa Kham Waan. The Neua Naam Tok was this flank steak salad that was amazing. It was in seasonings with fish sauce. The meat was perfectly seasoned and super tender and juicy. The Muu Paa kham Waa was very good. I don't like spicy food, and this dish is very spicy, but I enjoyed it tremendously. The flavors complement very well!

But honestly, if the food would have knocked our socks off like I thought it was going to, the atmosphere wouldn't have mattered. 

Service was mediocre at best.  Our server, though friendly enough, nearly forgot we were there as he focused all his attention on a larger party. The menu had more pork dishes than anything else.  Definitely not enough variety for those that don't eat pig.  Maybe pork is a staple in Northern Thailand, but in Portland it would be nice to see more seafood and vegetarian dishes on the menu. The few choices we were left with just weren't that good.   Small portions and large prices. They charge for steamed rice.  Really?!  And for soda refills. Are you kidding me? Our rice noodle/catfish dish was overcooked and oily, and the lemongrass stuffed cornish hen was flavorless.  We left disappointed and probably won't be back.

Otherwise, you'll enjoy everything on Pok Pok's menu as long as you're not a picky eater.

I'm glad I did.

The best thing I ate at Pok Pok were:
Pok Pok's house wings - hot and fresh from the kitchen. These wings have an amazing depth of flavor with savory and a hint of sweet. These wings are plump, juicy and a bit of a mess. Awesome wings!

Strangely enough, the other item I liked best was the ice cream sandwich dessert ($7). In a brioche bun that looked like a lobster roll bun, three tiny scoops of coconut ice cream lie atop some jackfruit shavings along with a sprinkling of peanuts. The slight savoriness of the bun and the delicate coconut tasting ice cream was wonderful.

A miss were:
Ribs with dipping sauce ($14). Nothing particularly out of the ordinary about these Asian-style riblets - except there was a small portion and the ribs were cut up in pieces.

Curry noodle soup ( Khao soi) was meh. The soup was lukewarm and there were that many noodles. For our choice of meat, we chose chicken and got a drumstick and a thigh thrown in as if we were eating at a tribal meal in Thailand - sort of rough looking meat.

Obviously there are probably items we'll have to come back and try.

Although we can't comment too much on the authenticity of the food, our experience was spoiled by several factors:

1. We asked for a bottled beer (the Full Sail lager from Mt. Hood), and when it was brought to us we noticed it had expired almost two months ago. We demanded for another one in exchange and were brought another one, but it was not a good start for us.

2. The duck leg stew we ordered supposedly came with a duck egg, but we are pretty certain that the one we had was a regular chicken egg, and it was pretty bland and tasteless to boot.

3. This isn't a major thing as this happens everywhere, but the serving sizes are a bit on the small size for the money. 

Of the four items we ordered, we only really enjoyed the boar collar. Even though it's a bit expensive for the small serving size, the meat is jam-packed with flavor that I had expected from Pok Pok. The other three dishes were quite meh and were not the same as the sweet, sour, and spicy that we expected with Thai food (we've been to Bangkok before) and were a bit on the salty side.

Onto the review...

I always feel kinda funny eating at ethnocentric food establishments run by white folks (I shouldn't have judgements but I can't help it.) That said, the food itself is pretty good. The overly hyped wings were way too salty though. The other two mains we ordered tasted ok albeit a tad small. Nothing particularly memorable (I'm writing this a year after we ate here so I don't recall the exact items we ate.) 

Service was pretty good, although for a rickety-shack divey atmosphere with bustling servers moving about in cramped quarters, the prices seem out of line. 

But from a strictly flavor standpoint, the food is pretty good (but nowhere near the title of Best Thai in Portand, much less the U.S....let's not insult the mom and pop Thai restaurants that do an awesome job of pumping out excellent Thai food)

sidenote: those super expensive ""drinking vinegars"" you see sold at Pok Pok and the Whiskey Soda Lounge? Try the bottles of Korean hongcho concentrate at Asian markets around town.

Cha Ca La Vong (catfish) was spot on. Excellent balanced flavors. 

Tam Kai Yaang (chicken salad) I liked this a lot due to the diff. kinds of greens, but it was way spicy for my current state. 

Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings were tasty but came to us lukewarm, which meant by the time we came to picking up the last wing, it was stuck to the plate. Not attractive. 

We couldn't stop staring at the other tables and what people were ordering, especially the whole catfish special they had that night. The whole menu looks mouthwatering.

Sticky Rice - good
Pork Belly/Pork Shoulder Stew - not melt in your mouth; c'mon I could do better

I'm sure that's the equivalent, in my world, of spaghetti and meatballs and chicken alfredo (which doesn't actually exist in Italy).  But Pok Pok, thank you for opening my eyes to a breadth of genuine flavors and dishes from this delicious country!  If this is what it really is, sign me up!

However, I am still, very clearly, a complete novice and therefore do not pretend to understand the complexities of this cuisine.  Thus, my commentary will be, probably to the relief of some, limited.  :)  I'll do the best I can, but hopefully the pictures of this beautiful food will be enough to make your mouth water.

I think this first one was my fave.  Prawns and pork belly baked in clay pot with bean thread noodles and a bunch of other delicious salty stuff.  Mmmmm... sticky and rich.
 
It was so good I made my photographer get a shot of the sticky stuff on the bottom.  I went in for the scrap.  I probably shouldn't have; I was bloated for 2 days.  Nah... it was worth it.
 
The Vietnamese fish sauce chicken wings are a house specialty.  Marinated in a fish sauce concoction, deep fried then tossed in said fish sauce concoction with garlic.  Um, ok.  I'd take these at a bar with a beer any day.
 
Charcoal grilled prawns with a spicy lime/garlic/cilantro root dipping sauce.  I managed to miss tasting this one but wasn't disappointed about it.  If I had to miss one, this was it because it was the most understandable to me.  I like to get my hands in the weird stuff.
 
Weird stuff like this: grilled boar collar meat.  Marinated and sauced.  Served with chilled mustard greens that were to be used as a chaser.  I'm not exactly sure what the whole concept is there.  I guess I could see it if it were more spicy but it wasn't super hot.  Maybe it's just tradition?  Regardless, the meat was wonderful.
 
Sauteed water spinach with garlic.  I always go for the greens.  They were simple, fresh and light.  Nothin' too special... just good, yummy greens.
 
Bean thread noodles' competition:  Braised pork shoulder and belly curry with a bunch of crazy stuff like tamarind, palm sugar, turmeric, Burmese curry powder (whatever that is) and pickled garlic.  It was suggested that we eat this one with coconut rice (unpictured).  Good suggestion.
 
Clearly the place is very casual.  Here's the specials board.  Notice the 'drinking vinegars' in the bottom left corner.  They're mixed into some wonderfully interesting cocktails.  They also have a massive list of whiskeys.  Thailand, I think you and I are going to get along just fine...
 
Apparently the place started as just a little shack with very few menu items, including the rotisserie chicken.  It's been expanding little by little.  There's lots of cool, sectioned patio spaces in which to eat and drink.  The indoor space is teensy... like, I could have rested my head on the lady sitting at the table behind me.
 
As for the service, it was pretty slow.  It seemed like the staff was so laid back (maybe that's just a Portland thing) and they all know that they have such a great reputation that everyone will just wait.  And we did.  Our server was very knowledgable and quite helpful, though.  We couldn't have done it without him.  Plus, he's the one that suggested the bean thread noodles so he's good in my book!

Service:  7
Ambiance:  8
Overall impression:  9
Would I go back?

Food was too salty. The wings are too salty and heavily seasoned with fish sauce. Larb was also too salty. Papaya salad was just ok.
Service was a little rude. The guy who took our order seemed a little annoyed but that's understandable. My hearing is pretty bad so I had a hard time making out what he was trying to say. The waiter who brought out our food was a jerk. He brought out wings and I asked if it was the spicy one or not since our table had ordered three plates. The waiter paused and says ""this is the wings... this is the hot wings..."" Finally the bus boy had the table hand down the dirty plates. My friend made a comment that we're not going to order desserts so they can clean the table after we leave. His rebuttal was to get a head start. However we were the last table of the night...

It was served with a cucumber/green pepper/onion salad so infused with jalapeno that I literally couldn't eat it for the heat. I have no quibble with the meal, as it was perfectly tasty for what it was, but the price for a lunch-sized entree that seemed more like an appetizer, plus a pint of beer, came to over $20.00 before tip!

This place doesn't take reservations for parties under 6, so expect to wait a while to be seated.

When I walked past the entrance to use the restroom, I heard that the wait time was around 1 hour.

[SERVICE]
Our server asked if it was our first time and broke down the menu for us since there's so much going on. He gave us the recommended dishes along with the most popular items on the menu. Once we were ready to order and the food came out, he recommended how we should eat the food to enhance our dining experience and continued to check up on us throughout the meal. Five stars for service!

[FOOD]
- Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - (5/5) These wings were a must try because they were featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives! We ordered one order spicy and the other order non-spicy. The spicy ones were definitely my favorite item on the menu! A great blend of sweet and spicy, and the perfect seasoning! 

- Muu Paa Kham Waan - (4/5) Boar collar meat, something I've never had before! This is an incredibly spicy dish, so eat with caution! Our server recommended pairing this with sticky rice. Because this dish is so spicy it comes with chilled vegetables for you to cleanse your palate. Very tender and full of flavor!

- Kaang Hang Leh - (4.5/5) Sweet pork belly and pork shoulder curry. This dish is exactly like a Taiwanese braised pork belly dish, but with different flavors and seasoning. I enjoyed this dish a lot with rice. The curry was a little runny and the dish was very sweet for a savory dish, but still incredibly delicious!

*Note: These dishes did not come with rice, so be sure to get some rice along with your order.

My mouth was just bursting with flavor! The pork belly curry and the khao soi are both wonderful rainy day choices.  The pork belly was so tender and such a wonderful mix of flavors and spices. The curry seemed slightly more like a stew, to be honest, but that's not necessarily a problem.  The khao soi was more subtle in flavor but very satisfying; so soothing and comforting!

Our favorite by far were the Spicy Viet Fish Sauce Wings.  So perfectly made! Beautifully crispy without being too fried. And so tender and juicy.  I will say that our wings were not spicy in the least! Both my friend and I love spicy food so we were definitely expecting more kick to them. They did bring some chili paste.

And I'm Thai. I ordered the classic -- Grilled Chicken with somtum and sticky rice. I was impressed with the chicken. Usually, I find most Thai restaurants have a problem with the chicken being too dry. Pok Pok go the chicken part right. The somtum was also not bad. It's hard to please every palate where the somtum is concern because everyone has their own preference. In Thailand, if you order somtum, the person making it usually will ask you how you like it. So, each somtum is customized to the individual. For example, you might say 2 or 3 chilis, not too sweet nor too sour, etc. The papaya could have been pounded a bit more though. You want to sort of smash the strands down and get all the seasonings to blend in well together. But overall not bad. I don't know if it was worth the major hype, but it was not bad. Unfortunately, since I was by myself I couldn't order other dishes that I was interested in. I liked the atmosphere of the place. Reminded me of hole in the wall places in Thailand. I thought it was funny that most of the wait staff were all 'farang' (white westerners). I'm use to most Thai restaurants having Thai wait staff. Not necessarily a bad thing. Just noting the difference from what I'm use to seeing ..... and also this seems to be a Portland thing. I went into a Japanese place down the street on a different night, and also the staff -- cooks, waiters etc. -- were all farangs too!!  And they were yelling out the Welcome in Japanese at all the people entering the place!  (This is messing with my head yo! Lol!)  And this being Portland, I also noted the vinegar drink on the board and craft brews. Even in a Thai place, you're still getting that Portland twist to it. (This town is so endearing.)

We went ahead and ordered the Ike's Vietnamese Fish as everyone had good things to say about it. We also ordered a bowl of jasmine rice and a papaya salad.

Food came out really fast. The papaya salad was good and pretty authentic. We got spicy and it wasn't that spicy. And on to the wings... It was SO salty. Do the chefs not know it's so salty? It seems like all the reviews i've read have mentioned about the wings being too salty. It's definitely too salty to enjoy in my opinion.  The flavor was ok. I do taste the fish sauce and it is mild and not overpowering, but just toooooooooooo salty. Also with the spice levels, it was not spicy at all. I do believe the ""spicy"" tolerance of people around here are different. The wings are so overrated in my opinion and SOOO overpriced. Six wings for $15.75.. are you serious? What makes these wings worth this much? It was so disappointed. My sister and I were not able to enjoy the food nor was able to finish it. 

I seriously believe the wings are placed at a higher price point because of the attention it gets. No matter how high the price will be, curious people like myself will still try it because of the hype. Please save yourself $16.

When we first arrived, we were told that it was a 2 and a half hour wait for 2 people. I then asked about the bar and counter space and that shortened the wait to 5 minutes. 

I typically judge a place by how well they make their Som Tum (papaya salad). IT WAS AWESOME! It's not as hot as I've had it at home, but it was done just right. I was ready to order a second dish, but was already stuffed with our other items. Might just get that one by itself the next time!

Our second dish was the broken crepe. Now it said it was ""street cart food"" that you'd find in Thailand. I don't recall seeing anything like it while in Thailand, but then again, I haven't tried every street cart. It was really good. I loved the bean sprouts and meat with it.

The third dish was a pork belly and pork shoulder curry. There were about 4 pieces of meat in there, 1 was nothing but pure fat. This was our least favorite and we'll probably order something else next time.

On a different note, if you like pickled relish, beware... they add thai chili to it and man did it just burn my mouth! This was way hotter than the Som Tum!

Okay, it's ""Wings"" but you know what i'm saying. I came here a while back so this review is a bit outdated. However, when I think of Portland .... I think of Pok Pok. I love how the restaurant is build inside of a home, and there are a variety of seatings from outdoor patio (literally sitting in the backyard of the house) to inside of the home. 

I came here with my friend and we waited appx 1 hour for a table for 2. Its located inside of a residual area so you don't get much option to ""explore"" around the neighborhood. However, I did accidentally walked inside of an adult toy store thinking it was a pet's store (don't even ask!) which is located directly across the street. So for those with children... it is NOT a pet store. 

The chicken wings are absolutely amazing! the spicy, tangy and sweet flavor will explode in your mouth and will not leave you disappointed. My friend is vegetarian, and sometimes my stomach only let me eat like a rabbit, so I didn't get to try other dishes. 

As for drinks, I got the tamarind mojito (?) and it was different.  It definitely had a strong kick though because I recall getting a bit buzzed half way through. I did wished it had more of the tamarind flavor.

We waited 15 minutes or so right behind another couple for a table and were seated in less time than they had projected. That's where the good news stops.

After being seated we were completely ignored by the staff for the next 15 minutes. I am not exaggerating (the table sat directly before us had food on their table before we were able to order).15 minutes until our waitress finally graced us with her presence to help us with our food selections. We knew we wanted the signature dish, the lemongrass stuffed game hen, but weren't sure what else to order. I wanted something a little spicy, but not too spicy, and communicated clearly. What we ended up with was a beef dish so spicy i took one bite and was thrown into coughing fits. I took another bite with plenty of rice and it was still too spicy. My dining partner loves spicy food, but no. it was too spicy for him as well. As for the game hen, I didn't know you could make a game hen that dry without trying. 

I don't expect waitstaff to bend over backwards for me. I've been in the food service industry for the past 17 years. I understand that when it's busy it's busy and you can't always get to a table right away.. forgiven. no big deal. However, never in my life have I left a restaurant so hungry that I had to get pizza afterward. 

The carefully packed up leftovers made their way to my refrigerator where my drunken room mate found the beef dish and ate it in it's entirety only to immediately regret it, and then regret it some more over the next few days.

But boy was I so wrong... I haven't been to Thailand or Vietnam, but I imagine that they would serve foods like this there. This was probably one of the most authenic asian restaurants that I've been to. 

When I first walked in, I noticed that it had a very chill vibe. There were indoor seating, but also had a few tables in a tent like space with heating lamps above us (thank god cause it was pretty chilly). We got seated fairly quickly and the waiter came to us with water (which tasted like rice infused water). Then he proceeded to explain each of the foods and told us about the family sharing style of eating that they endorse when we told him that we've never been here. The waiter here were so informative about the foods that they serve and answered all our questions (cause that menu is so extensive!)

We heeded his advice and got the wings to share. We opted for the mild options, which had a fish sauce taste. It was crispy on the outside and just the right texture on the inside. It was great. 

Next, my friend and I shared the kung op wun sen (which is a claypot with pork belly, noodles, shrimp and much more). It was pretty filling for its size and we both enjoyed it.

And well it certainly did. And so did the price! Almost $200.00 for 5 people yikes! But we eat a lot. That's what families do. We ordered 2 wing sets which were much bigger than I thought they would be. The flavor is what makes this place great. They keep it authentic. No spice level changes. Just straight up good food. It was a nice fish sauce flavor on crispy tender wings. We were hooked. The Chang beer was flowing and this was the best introduction to our vacation in the PNW. 

We also ordered the skirt steak salad. (This was a bit dry. They didn't have a lot of fat on it) The papaya salad had a good balance of flavor. We got some Thai sausage that was amazingly cooked. And plenty of sticky rice (aka sleepy rice for me). My brother of course had to get some pork belly too - his favorite.

For dinner, we ordered:

1. Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - $15.50
I'm not going to talk about this too much since every other review talks about it. My opinion was that this was too flavorful. The tangy-ness sort of killed the roof of my mouth...it was weird and I can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly. 

1. Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar meat) - $15.50
This dish comes spicy, sauce over the boar meat, but I'm a wimp when it comes to spiciness so we had it on the side (offered by our server who was super nice!). The meat was tender and it comes with iced mustard greens to neutralize your palette after the spicy sauce. I thought it was a gimmick, but it really worked!! This was my favorite dish.

2. Yam Makheua Yao (charcoal grilled eggplant) - $14.50
This also comes spicy so we requested to have the Thai chilies on the side. This dish is really flavorful, but not to the point where it's overpowering. The eggplants are cooked just right and really soak in all the flavors of the dish.

3. Hoi Thawt (crispy broken crepe) - $13.50
This was a tasty snack, but I could skip next time. I felt like there was too much egg and not enough mussels in the dish. As described on the menu, this is definitely a night market food.

The restaurant was part indoor and outdoor seating in what looked like two houses turned restaurant. I prayed we wouldn't sit outdoors since it was freezing even with the heaters (and I'm not a stranger to cold since I come from SF). The decorations were cute, with lights strung outside and going for that thai/viet theme. 

So those chicken wings were the whole reason why most reviewers go to this place and it wasn't spectacular to my friends and I. It's not any San Tung chicken (SF local) but if you order spicy it has a kick to it that just messed it up for us. The fish sauce was obviously used but I would cut down on the fish sauce. 
The Glass noodles were yummy though and my favorite dish in the whole night!! It was flavored just right but the downside is that with the size of the clay pot you would expect to be getting more noodles. I would get it again but would have to order 2 to have enough for 3 people. 
The last thing we and was steak salad which I have to say is decent but on the sour side. I get that most thai larb salads are like that but Ive also been to places that can balance the sour salad dressing just right to not make it overwhelming.

That definitely would deter people from going so it's probably because I didn't go during the most ideal of conditions. 

We were sat inside away from the rain and cold. We were greeted promptly by our waitress and asked if we'd like anything to drink and were given time to look at the menu. The menu is not like a typical Thai restaurant, and probably where all of the appeal lies. It was hard for me to choose since everything was so foreign to me, but I settled on the Khanom jiin naam phrik with coconut rice. I can say right now that I do not regret my decision whatsoever. The main dish had some cabbage that added some crunch to the food and the noodles and vegetables blended in well. It had some pureed shrimp in it which you could taste and added some thickness to the soup. Just a forewarning, the dish comes with a super spicy sauce that you should use in moderation, so just be careful when eating it along with your meal. The coconut rice is a must since the change of pace from traditional white rice is always nice.

The place is small so plan on waiting for a table. When I went at 5:30 on a Sunday, we still had a half hour wait time. But no fear, Pok Pok owns the bar across the street, Whiskey Soda Lounge so head over there to get started. 

At the bar, we were able to order the famed Tasting Vinegars and Fish Sauce Wings. They both lived up to the hype. The wings were salty, sweet and delicious. The vinegars were so unique: sweet with a vinegar kick at the end. 

For dinner we had the Wingbean Special Salad, the Boar Collar, and the Cornish Game Hen. Everything was amazing. The wingbean and boar collar were stand outs. The wingbean had a great peanut sauce. The boar collar was tender, spicy, and a little gamey. It was served with mustard leaf to cut the heat. The cornish game hen was good too, but much more plain than the other two dishes.

(If you are one of the lucky ones who gets to eat regularly...rejoice, be grateful, and always treat a meal with reverence.)

I love food experiences. Cheeky and informed servers. Good vibes. Thoughtful decor that parallels the food offerings. Bar tenders who understand the care of cocktails. Clean plating. All the stuff that makes the food, when delivered, taste even better. 

Unless it's Pok Pok. 

They could serve me their food, in an alley, on a trash can lid, with a feral cat as my dinner companion and I'd STILL give it 5 stars. 

I've eaten here numerous times and am heading back in November. My mouth is already watering. Many of the dishes are served as shares...family style. Andy was named best NW Chef. I own the Pok Pok cookbook. Best Thai in the country. No joke. 

So, I'm gonna keep this simple. Here are a few of the things I love at Pok Pok. 

Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings. I feel that everyone should have a taste of these before they die. 

Yam Samun Phrai. It is nothing short of a party in your mouth. If I were you I'd make sure you are firmly seated when taking the first bite. 

Laap Pet Isaan. Laap is one of my fav Thai dishes. I always get it, when available, at Thai restaurants. It's fun to see how each one prepares it. Pok Pok takes it to a whole other level with duck, duck skin (have mercy) and duck livers. Bursting with a medley of well layered flavors.

Pork Belly. Anything they serve with pork belly is worth eating. Especially if it's cooked for two days and served in a little crock. 

Vegetarians, relax, lots of wonderful dishes available for you too!

I have had their cocktails, 
Bloody Mary- really good with the wings. 
Hunny - grapefruit juice with lime, honey drinking vinegar and tequila. Everything fresh squeezed. 

Never had desert, not enough room. Stuffed.

So take a walk, let it digest and the head to Salt and Straw (artisan ice cream) right down the street.

Pok Pok and S&S are two of my fav places to eat in the Northwest. Or anywhere for that matter.

Seriously? It's rice. How much can it possibly be worth to you. By the way, it was undercooked and we received a complimentary jasmine rice for noting it to them. 

It left me pretty disgusted that he wouldn't just check the rice and bring us a new bowl. Really soured my experience here.

If you seek comfort in phad Thai and three or four colors of curry to put on chicken, shrimp or tofu, then do not go to Pok Pok. 

On March 6, 2010, other diners beat us to Pok Pok, so the sweet young woman directing traffic offered us appetizers and drinks across the street at their Wiskey Soda Lounge to wait the estimated 1 hour.  There, the firey Chinese fungus forced me to gulp Thai iced tea to restore order to my taste buds.  The other two appetizers we shared were more within my tolerance.  There are no asterisks or red peppers on the menu to warn diners; you should ask how spicy.  The music was a little too loud & intense, with bad sound quality, which distracted diners rather than enhanced the venue.  Maybe at 11:00 p.m., when people are louder and drunk, the music would be less dominant.

Back at Pok Pok, we all found something we wanted, plus sticky rice and coconut rice.  The authentic sticky rice, alone, is almost worth the trip to Pok Pok. Off the top of my head, I can't think of other restaurants in Portland that make sticky rice as well.  The other items were pretty good.  The Asian music here was much better than at the ante restaurant, and did, in fact, evoke a return to Thailand. 

Some creative drinks, and pleasant servers.

Today, I finally made it.  Turns out, Pok Pok has no lines during their weekday lunch service.

We ordered the Kai Yang Chicken - Charcoal toasted stuffed with herbs and spices- chicken was moist, but blander tasting than I expected (expectation based on the description).  The 2 sauces were good and made the bites of chicken taste distinctly different depending on which sauce the chicken was dipped into.

Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings was clearly the star of the meal.  Great flavor and crunch.  The 6 wing portion is equivalent to 12 wings compared to the typical chicken wing service since each wing included the drumette and the wing part.

I brought a couple of the wings home to pair with the Pok Pok Rhubarb Shandy that I had in my refrigerator- the Shandy paired really well with the wings.

I enjoyed the Kung Op Wun Sen - Prawns baked in a clay pot with clear noodles very much.  The chef used caramelized onions to create a great taste experience.

I recommend the sticky rice over the jasmine rice to go with the chicken wings while the jasmine rice was a better pairing for the Kai Yang Chicken.

On a whim, I decided to go to Pok Pok for Lunch. On the Trimet, it's a simple ""jump to the left"" (#70 Bus), then a ""step to the right"" (#4). And as much as watching people is fun regarding my fellow sometimes nerdy professionals, being on a Portlandia Bus is even better. My favourite overhead conversation today was a lady asking the bus driver if he could extend his route an extra hour so that she could get home more conveniently.

Pok Pok is a popular place and I had been previously advised that going for lunch during the week might better assure a seat at the table or bar. That was certainly true today, although by the time I left, the place was full both inside and outside.

The service could have been better than today's ""A-OK"". My waiter had the expected friendly and casual Portland personality. However, he was a bit detached, slow in taking my order, short on menu choice explanations, and maybe a tiny bit flip on top of that. I've seen stronger versions of that behaviour before at well regarded restaurants that let all the praise they receive go to their head. But in the end, I let it go and decided to just enjoy the space, the energetic mid-day vibe, and of course my meal.

The food was simply fabulous. I ordered the Phat Si Ew (a woked pork, vegetables, and rice noodles dish) and am still marvelling at the rich variety of flavours that came rushing in and around my pallet at every bite.

I called her back and thanked her, she said she gets those calls a lot and to try to chicken wings. =)

I eventually dialed the right number and the hostess suggested that I didn't need reservations for 2.  But to tell you the truth, I wish I made reservations for 2 because we still had to wait and the only seats open were the bar seats and the ones outside next to the rice cookers.  The set up of this place is pretty wicked.  There's an indoor area that's tightly packed and then outdoor areas that are covered and then an area in between where a few people can sit for a quick meal.

The only reason I heard about this place was from my friend who is from Portland and after that, I started seeing the name ""Pok Pok"" EVERYWHERE.

Apparently, Pok Pok is only found in Portland and New York. It's a Northern Thai restaurant, meaning that they won't have your typical curry dishes or your pad thai (both of which are more central Thailand food). The only dish that actually has coconut in it (since it's scare in Northern Thailand) is their Tom Kha. 

So what's great about this place? EVERYTHING! We had the opportunity to try out a number of their dishes. A lot of the waitresses and waiters will keep reiterating that Pok Pok is meant for a shared food experience, and I also echo that. Order a number of dishes and eat it family style. The portion sizes are a bit small for each dish and so it's meant to distribute around the table. If I recall correctly, we got their fish sauce wings, the boar meat, waterfall beef tom kha, the pok pok papaya salad, and cat fish noodles. 

First of all, the fish sauce wings were amazeballs. There are a number of places in the US that are known for amazing chicken wings (such as San Tung's garlic wings in SF), and Pok Pok's wings definitely rank up there. The sauce wasn't too overwhelming and the wings were cooked perfectly. It's a nice dish to try and I highly recommend it.

Second, the Tom Kha was probably one of my favorite parts of our meal. It isn't hard to make a coconut curry soup, but they added the perfect blend of coconut milk and curry in there. The soup was flavorful, not too creamy, and overall delicious. This is another one of those items that you need to share with other people.

Third, the waterfall beef and wild boar were tender and SO JUICY. They both taste a bit different and the sauces that are used have some distinctions, but you really do need to try each. We got extra leaves and ice to use with the wild boar because it was apparently spicy - it wasn't. Portion size is small so please be aware of that!

The curry catfish was another great dish. It's pretty much vermicelli noodles and catfish in an oily, curry sauce. It comes in a small bowl and works well with a salad or piece of lettuce on the side.

Last, we tried the pok pok papaya salad. The menu warns that htis dish is very spicy, but it really isn't if you have any experience with spicy food. Again, portion size is small but very delicious regardless!

Don't forget the drinks though! The waitress recommended the non-alcoholic ginger/vinegar drinks and they were splendid. I ordered the black pepper one and it tasted unique with a bit of a kick to it.

Overall, Pok Pok is a perfect experience with fine Thai dining. You really don't get many opportunities to try Northern Thai food unless you are actually in Thailand (Chang Mai). The only reason why I give this place 4 stars is because the portion sizes are a bit TOO small for me for the price. Though we ordered a lot, we ended up paying about $30 a person, and I feel like that is a bit much for Thai food.

However, you need to check this place out...

Everything else we had was great too , the pork belly was delicious the Brussel Sprouts were delicious and I could go on and on about how much I love Pok Pok!

I had never heard of it and had assumed it was a food truck...turns out it's pretty much the opposite of what you'd expect from a food truck (except for the atmosphere).

I think Valerie L sums it up best by saying ""this isn't the best Thai food I ever had, but it definitely is delicious."" None of the dishes we had would be considered Thai - maybe Pok Pok is better described as ""Southeast Asian Fusion."" And that's a culinary style I would love to see more of because it is amazing. But what I think is ultimately preventing me from shelling out the 5 stars with abandon is the price and the overly hyped Fish Sauce Chicken Wings. I could faintly taste the difference in chicken quality compared to what I usually get in Chinatowns or Costcos in California (i.e., hormone-pumped goodness), but the sauce and flavor of the chicken wings themselves were really nothing special. Because of the price ($14?!), it's not something I would order again next time I visit.

What I did love was literally everything else. We ordered the catfish vermicelli with herbs and the Burmese-inspired pork belly stew (both $15 each). We were in heaven. The vermicelli was quite possibly the best I ever had and helped offset the oils from the catfish. The catfish was cooked to perfection, not a single bite tasted rubbery, and the peanuts worked seamlessly with the herbs to enhance the fish. The pork belly stew was nothing novel for me, but the tenderness of the meat really blew my mind. Every bite was perfect and the curry was rich with flavor and fat. I highly recommend ordering a bowl of rice if you're going to eat this dish. All and all, a great dining experience. Even now, as I write this review MONTHS after this meal, I feel like I can relive the whole thing. The flavors of these dishes are very vivid, and they stay with you long after you've digested!

I'm also a huge fan of Pok Pok's drinking vinegars. I ordered the ginger flavor and highly recommend it. We were too stuffed to even try a dessert, but I noticed people opted to get their sugar cravings satisfied at the nearby Salt & Straw.

On a random note, I love how Pok Pok deals with its popularity - you can put your name on a waitlist and then you'll be directed to right across the street to the Whiskey Soda Lounge, a bar with one of the most extravagant selections of whiskeys I've ever seen. Once your table is ready, the host or your waiter at Whiskey Soda Lounge will notify you. Genius business move on the part of the owners of Pok Pok, but also great for customers too because it's a fantastic way to kill time. The Whiskey Soda Lounge also has some noms (like the chicken wings, not that I'd recommend them) and even the drinking vinegars that I am now obsessed with. 

And in case you are wondering, yes you will definitely have to wait, unless you arrive very early for lunch.

The famous Ike's wings were way salty and expensive. I have had much better and cheaper back home in California.

The pork belly curry was great. However they only gave 4 pieces of pork belly. Curry was very spicy FYI. Combination of the curry and coconut rice was recommended which was what we got but I thought that the rice was too overpowering.

The waiters were rude to everyone. I sat outside on the bar so I could see everything going on. After waiting a good 10 minutes for someone to take our order, we finally waved someone over only to have him shut us down and to tell us to talk to our server. And then as time goes on I see him be equally as rude to others who were standing on the sidewalk waiting to be seated - people were confused by the chaos and naturally had questions. The last thing I heard him say was ""do you have a reservation?"" ""no? Wait over there."" they were all really busy and I could see all the waiters hustling but as a customer I expected to be treated as a paying customer.

This is right in the heart of the hip SE Division strip.  (Warning: make time to find parking, and good luck!)  Very quaint ambience -- the restaurant is an addition to an old home and evokes a rustic homey feel, with simple wooden furniture, ceiling fans, and tiny kitchen quarters with big cauldrons on stilts. 

Service:
Knowledgeable and accommodating staff who are genuinely proud of their restaurant and their hugely popular chef.  There was a surprisingly short line when we arrived, and the hostess was nice enough to give us some extra time while the hubby scoured for parking.

Food:
James Beard award winner Andy Ricker definitely knows how to put up a meal that would keep you coming back from more -- I'm getting hungry just remembering these.

I loved that they offered mustard leaves to help you cool down your mouth and cleanse your palate between bites.  I honestly remembered the boar being better when I came here the first time.  Now I think it's over drenched in sauce.

We arrived on a Saturday around lunch time and luckily there was no wait. My jaw literally dropped when I saw the prices on the menu. $15.50 for WINGS?! These better be some amazingly delicious wings! Since most of the dishes were meant to be served family style, we settled for the fish sauce wings and Neua Naam Tok (steak salad). I ordered a side of their coconut rice.

The wings were definitely flavorful.. maybe a little too flavorful.. to the point that it was salty. The chicken was cooked perfectly though and we still enjoyed it. After tasting the wings, my boyfriend decided he did need a side of rice to go with his meal. The wings weren't as overbearing when eaten with rice.

 The real winner though was the steak salad! It was seasoned just right and the beef really soaked in all the flavors and was tender. It's probably the best beef salad I've ever had! Their coconut rice was also delicious, it had just a the right hint of coconut flavor.

I would definitely recommend trying this place out if you're in Portland, not for the wings but for their Neua Naam Tok (steak salad).

Save for a semi-rude encounter at the door (not Pok Pok's fault) - I enjoyed every bit of my dining experience at the famous Pok Pok in PDX!

Reservations were super easy to make online. I even realized I made a slip up (forgot 2 ppl in my reservation...oops) day of and they were able to accommodate the larger party.

Pok Pok is located inside of what looks like a home. We were seated inside the house (upstairs so a little tough for those with difficulty...would recco you request seating downstairs next to the bar area). The decor was kitschy and the music was loud, but the food was phenomenal. 

Our waiter was the typical PDX hipster, not super enthusiastic but got the job done and checked on us multiple times as well as refilled our waters/our special request for hot water. As a group of 8 we ordered doubles of the following:

- Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings: So good!!!! Worth all the hype and MORE. Tender, sticky, with just the right amt of sweetness. Loved this!

- Kai Yaang Tuua (whole roasted chicken): It's the whole chicken so some of the pieces tend to be drier than others. Comes with a bunch of dipping sauces, so that helped. Other than that, decent but unmemorable. 

- Kaeng Hang Leh (Northern Thai sweet pork belly and pork shoulder curry): A Chiang Mai classic! Everyone kept pouring the curry sauce over their rice - it was THAT good!

- Kung Op Wun Sen (prawn and pork belly casserole): prawns were seriously large and it was served with vermicelli which sopped up allllll dat sauce! 

Topped it off with a few Thai iced teas and a Pilsner (beer...when in PDX!) and we were all happy and full! Super exciting especially when you consider I was traveling with family and their palates tend to be all over the place (i.e., Chinese specific). This was unique enough to win them over.

I've never been to Portland before and would never have thought this type of delicacy had graced this great land. 

All these reviews talk about the wings and there's a reason for it. The skin had a slight crunch to it, while keeping the meat at a juicy, tender level. Their wings were sooo tasty. They were sweet and packed a little bit of heat. The group and I ordered a couple orders of these at first, then added about 3 more orders. WORTH IT!

We let our waiter recommend and pick the rest of our entrees so we could see what else this popular spot had to offer. There was way too much food for all of us.

My review is solely based on having tried only this one dish. To my dismay, the wings were on the saltier side. It was a good blend of seasoning but I just wished it wasn't so loaded on sodium. I've had Vietnamese fish sauce wings in little Saigon Orange County that are not as loaded with sodium and still tasted really good. I'd highly recommend you order a side of sticky rice or jasmine rice to pair with the chicken wings unless you have a high tolerance for lots of salt. The amount of salt in this dish alone may exacerbate your blood pressure and heart failure lol. 

We came at 3:45pm on a Friday and still had to wait as a party of 6 for 30 minutes with no one else in front of us which is surprising. I could only imagine how horrendous the wait would be if we came during peak hours. In my opinion, the chicken wings alone are not a worthy dish to wait for. Now, I have not tried the rest of their menu so I am not sure if the other dishes are worth the wait.

Now, this would've been a-okay if it weren't for the fact that it was a chilly 40 degrees out that night and this restaurant doesn't offer complimentary hot tea (it was $4 a cup), and they only had herbal or early grey tea, which is weird and does not go with your Thai street-food meal). Anyway, it all just felt super anticlimactic given the long wait and the hype around this place, and I did not enjoy the fact that my hands were near-frozen all night.

The food was decent, but honestly didn't match the hype of the place. Perhaps it was because all the food so quickly turned cold. Okay, maybe I'm holding a grudge now. #shrug

We ordered Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings which were underwhelmingly flavored and not at all spicy. We also ordered the Cha Ca ""La Vong"", which we had tried in Vietnam. There were I think 4 small pieces of battered fried cod in the whole dish, which was very disappointing and felt cheap.

Alas, this was not so. We ordered the wing bean salad, the (spicy) fish sauce chicken wings, and the boar collar. The wing beans were good- a nice touch of coconut cream offset the garlic and sour spices and the prawns really gave the whole dish some nice heft.

However, the wings and the boar collar were disappointing. The first two wings were a little salty, but tasty. But after that, MSG coma set in. The taste seemed to dull with each passing wing until my wife and I were trying to convince each other to have the last one (""oh dear, PLEASE have the last bite!""). The boar collar really inconsistent- sour and puckering for one bite, white-hot for another bite. The meat itself was bleh- I would have preferred a nice ox tongue.

2. everyone who ever comes to portland is like you gotta stop by pok pok

The roasted peanuts though -- COME HERE FOR THE PEANUTS! 10/10 nailed it and i even got a bag to go so i guess there was some winning here!

the food - so the ike's wings are the #1 go to dish to order and i have to say it was really salty and for the two of us we couldn't even get past 1 each for ourselves. so maybe if you are an explorer and tread not with the crowd i'd say get the ribs instead and boy oh boy were those boooommmbbbb!!!

also underrated item the eggplant - its not vegan but i think you can ask to make it vegan since it has pork and egg bits in it but it was sour and soooo melty in your mouth. might just come back for that! 

this menu is really crowded as well and might be overwhelming so i suggest asking for suggestions. we got the ribs, wings and coconut rice and then we though maybe one other thing off the menu. wrong decision and wrong choice on the sausage. it was one long piece cut into small bites and it was like why'd i get this. but it would go really well in fried rice together but on its own, not so much.

I had heard great things about Pok Pok and was so glad I got around to eating here during my recent Portland visit.  We arrived around 8:15pm and were surprised to see that Pok Pok still had lots of people waiting around on a drizzly, cold Saturday night.  Luckily, my boyfriend convinced me to be patient and wait for an hour and a half - something that would usually deter me to go somewhere else immediately.  We left our phone number with the hostess, who told us we'd receive a call/text when our table was ready.  

We ended up driving to Target nearby to grab some snacks and kill time, and headed back around 9:45pm.  I approached the hostess, concerned that we may not be seated since the restaurant hours state closing at 10pm, and she said our table was ready and we could be seated inside!  (I didn't even realize there was inside seating, but it was definitely preferred since it was chilly outside.)

Our waitress greeted us warmly, and I noticed a few other tables being seating around the same time as us.  Business seemed to go on as usual despite the fact that they were technically closed!  Not sure when they close off allowing people to dine-in.  

We ordered the famous fish sauce wings and a curry noodle dish, with a side of sticky rice to share.  The food didn't take too long to arrive, and we had complimentary peanuts to snack on in the meantime.  I'm glad we held back when it came to ordering; the two dishes for us was plenty!  We even had a couple of wings and a little rice leftover.  While the curry noodle soup was warm and filling, I definitely think that the accompaniments helped dial up the flavors - squeezing in some lemon and adding some chili made the dish even more enjoyable.  The wings, on the other hand, were amazing from beginning to end to the next day when we reheated them for lunch.  We LOVED the wings and I would visit Pok Pok a million times just to order wings each time.  They definitely lived up to any expectation I had for them.  Yes, they were a little salty, but I thought it worked well with bites of rice and the pickled carrots, daikon, and cucumber that come with the dish.

Ikes Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings:  First of all these aren't tiny little wings, they're big and you get 6 of them.  I shared, but I could have kept them all to myself.  They are worthy of the praise they are given.  They're marinated in sugar and fish sauce, deep fried and tossed in garlic and caramelized fish sauce and served with a refreshing side of pickled daikon and carrots.  They were tender, juicy and bursting with flavor....it was heaven.  

Papaya Pok Pok Salad:  Well balanced, refreshing, sweet, spicy, tangy, crunchy papaya, a little bit of chewiness from the dried shrimp.  It was everything a papaya salad should be.....wish I had tried it Isaan style (with extra spicy dried chili) though.  

Hoi Thawt:  Crispy broken crepe with mussels, egg, garlic, chives and bean sprouts served with sriracha.  Lots of mussels and good rich flavor but not overwhelmingly so thanks to the bean sprouts.  

Cha Ca ""La Vong"":  Catfish medallions fried in turmeric oil with scallions and dill served over rice vermicelli.  They don't skimp on the fish, there is plenty of it and it is GOOD.  The dill added a really nice touch and much needed brightness to the dish.  Make sure you pour the sauce over and mix well so it gets on the noodles!  

I NEEDED a cocktail and so I turned to their specials board and asked the waitress what she suggested.  She said the Gin Rummy (gin, rum, lemon juice and thai basil ) was really different and though it sounded a bit boring to me, I decided to trust her and I'm glad I did.  I didn't expect it to be as good as it was and it really complimented the food perfectly.  

So, bottom line, if anyone tells me they're going to Porland, I too will now threaten ""go to Pok Pok or you'll be sorry!!!"" though I will add ""and please bring home some chicken wings for me.""",kUFduMl0quM5pKaGm0GZhA,3226 SE Division St,"Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Pan Asian, Thai, Filipino, Chicken Wings, Vietnamese",Portland,45.504723,-122.63210500000001,Pok Pok,97202,6221,4.0,OR,1

You have to do a really poor job to make a flavorless curry dish.  The noodles were on the soggy side in my dish, which should not happen at a place pike this.  Not the highest quality ingredients either.  For the prices I would expect much higher quality.  Pok Pok is an ""okay"" restaurant with decent service and mediocre to decent food, but it is not worth standing in line for and definitely not worth the prices they charge.  Seems like nothing more than just another over-hyped Portland fad.  I love this city and all the food options, but we do have a tendency to popularize places like this and extend the hype for far too long.  save your money and go someplace else just down the street.

For example, when Jeremy Lin got his championship with the Raptors, instead of saying cool bro what a journey, a lot of Asian Americans were like what an asterisk without taking into account how hard it is to be on an NBA roster. Also, I recently went to a dim sum place in SF that was ""not authentic"" and some of my friends commented that the place was ""overpriced"" or ""Americanized"".  

Let me pause here and say, can't we just celebrate and enjoy things for what they are if they are good? Freaking haters yo.  

I bookmarked Pok Pok because it is one of the most reviewed places in Portland. The wife and I pulled the plug for over a decade so my wife did not know the chef, Andy Ricker, was Caucasian. When I found out, I kept that part a secret to see how she would react. Guess what? She was surprised in a good way when I told her because the food was delicious. I think if you go into Pok Pok with preconceived biases or try to compare it to your nana's cooking, then you should just stay home because no one can compete with nana. Na-na-na. However, if you want to try food that is fresh, vibrant, and tasty, then book that reservation now. 

Pok Pok is the Thai onomatopoeia for the sound of wooden pestles hitting mortars to make papaya salads. I found out from a Filipino friend that pok-pok is slang for a prostitute in Tagalog lol. I guess I am a pok-pok for Pok Pok? Moreover, imagine if the ""o"" in Pok Pok were an ""e"", Pinays would be laughing all day. Although, some people might say Pok Pok smells like P*k P*k because of all the fish sauce ROFL. 

Fish sauce. 

I guess you either hate it or love it. I'm Korean so we have some funky smelly foods and a lot of people use fish sauce in kimchi so I don't mind it at all. But if you are not used to it, it's probably a sensory overload. And, Pok Pok's famous wings are marinated with a fish sauce marinade. We loved the wings which were super tasty and legit.  

Sidenote: I wondered why the wings were called Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings. I was like who the heck is Ike? Turns out Ike is the nickname for Mr. Ich ""Ike"" Truong who was Pok Pok's first employee (and still employed) when Pok Pok was just a street cart and the recipe is his family recipe from Vietnam.  

Since the restaurant is named Pok Pok, we had to get the papaya salad. It had the right amount of tang and zest and wasn't too spicy which I did not mind at all.  Another tasty dish that we got was the clay pot noodle dish with prawns called kung op wun sen. Very good. The coconut rice was good, but not worth $3.75. Maybe if they threw in some mangos? I would suggest just getting the regular jasmine rice. 

At the end of the day, I recommend that you Pick Pick Pok Pok if you are visiting Portland or if you just want some really tasty Southeast Asian food that tastes legit. 

Pok Pok has a dog-friendly patio, which is why it's 5 stars in my book! Hard to find dog-friendly restaurants that taste good and have great service. The struggle is real.

Actually, I should clarify.  I didn't barf, but my partner did, all night long.  Basically the mediocre catfish dish did her in.  It's some kind of pan seared and under-seasoned catfish (apparently the server's fav...God knows why) resting on rice noodles which are swimming in grease.  The noodles kind of resembled baby food.  Once you put them in your mouth you were dually fighting both the gritty mushy crumbling of over cooked rice along with the bubble of grease that was sloshing around in their and then eventually coating your stomach.  Fortunately for me, I took one bite of the noodles and then let them be.  Later, I survived the evening with merely gas, bloating and general indigestion.  My partner, who was not so lucky, had more than a few bites.  The revelation of the grease as we were eating told us that perhaps this was not the much talked about cuisine we were expecting.  We explained the grease situation to the waitress (who had previously been quite nice to us) and were confronted with a curt ""It's supposed to be like that.  Would you like your check?""  Well, yes, I guess we would...thanks.

The next day, we called the manager to explain the bout with food poisoning that was endured.  He tactfully gave us the run around by saying there was no way he could know if we were food poisoned by his restaurant because of blah blah blah.  He then suggested we call some kind of food and health thingy to assess what exactly gave us food poisoning.  I explained that she barfed up little puddles of Pok Pok grease (literally...they were floating around in the toilet), but he remained unconvinced.  Oh well.

In addition to the food poisoning, overall everything we had was highly unimpressive.  The chicken wings, also recommended by our server, were ridiculously overflavoured.  I felt like I was eating a brown sugared lollipop of a chicken wing.  The sweetness was overwhelming.  We also had the soup, which did not have an offensive flavor profile by any means, but it was just boring and also overly greasy.

Did I mention the drinks?  We both had lime infused vodka and gin drinks and both agreed it was like sucking on the rind of a lime the whole time.

However, with this said I give them KUDOS for their efforts. They are trying to recreate the ambience (and food) of Northern Thailand which is admirable but Thai BBQ Chicken is NEVER made with Cornish Game Hens. The bird just isn't part of the everyday fare. Cucumber Relish, Peanut Sauce, Shrimp Chips which are SO SO inexpensive are  usually served as complimentary side dishes at no extra charge. This kind of stuff plus the professionally bottled vinegar/Thai sauce gives me pause.

I agree it's 'cool', innovative and has a fun vibe but what I truly value is the quality of the food and for me, it misses the mark esp compared to other Thai restaurants in PDX that is more deserving of our patronage.

The muu paa kham waan was also good, but we all agreed that when we go again we'd order the other two things and try something new for the third. We loved the coconut rice. My mom was hesitant about it which is why we also got jasmine rice. I'm glad we got both though because I love rice and they were both great.

Pok Pok (saying that makes me LOL since pok pok in Filipino means hoe ) wasn't just recommended by DDD, but also from a lot of our friends. This Thai restaurant is COMPLETELY different from any Thai restaurants I know. Don't be expecting Pad Thai, Pad See Ew or Pineapple fried rice in their menu just FYI. 

Location & Parking: 3/5
Since the Pok Pok is located in the downtown area, parking can be a little hard to find. We had to park in one of the residential streets and walk down to the restaurant... in the rain 

Atmosphere & Ambience: 3/5
With how busy and small it is, they had to make do with whatever room they had. We ended up sitting in their ""outside area"" during winter, which was covered with a patio tarp and an overhead heater which helped with the cold.  

Service: 4/5 
The waiter was pretty nice and helpful with us first timers. He tried to explain the many to us, since the menu was kind of confusing to me. 

Food & Drinks: 4/5
Spicy Fish Sauce Wings (5/5) Definitely a must when going to Pok Pok. Highly recommend getting spicy only since the regular has less of a taste. The spicy isn't even that spicy for those of you who don't like spicy. 
Sii Khrong Muu Yaang (3/5) Their version of baby back ribs wasn't bad tasting, but just really just too dry for me. The ribs weren't meaty and just not worth over $10
Sunny's Yan Wun Sen (4/5) Glass noodles served in a clay pot, tasted like the Filipino dish called ""sotanghon"" to me. Don't forget to add some of the citrus sauce on the side to the dish, it really makes a difference.

They definitely serve food that most other Thai restaurant don't (because most other Thai restaurants have to cater to western tastes to survive), and you definitely get more ""Northern"" dishes.

Cha Ca La Vong- catfish marinated in turmeric. So melt in your mouth. 
Sticky rice- a staple to pair each of these dishes with. It balances out some of the flavors and do eat the greens as it helps tone down the saltiness in these dishes.

From the outside it felt like something I would see more in like the woods. Canopy tent, hanging lights, open concept, at least from the outside look. I know they have an interior area where people can sit and the bar is located. Waiting area is out in the open so you just stand there or you can put your name down then go across and hang out at the Whiskey Soda Lounge, which I found out is owned by Pok Pok. They notify you via text, and through Whiskey Soda Lounge, when your table is ready (which I really liked).

Interior = 4/5
There is a mixture of inside seating in a actual building and outside seating in what looked like a canopy tent. If it gets cold I can see people preferring the inside one - which concerns me a bit since there seemed to be more outside seating than inside. We went at dinner and were seated in the canopy tent and it was fine. The atmosphere outside felt like camp, inside (since I went to go look for the bathroom) was a bit more like a bar feel.

Service = 5/5
The servers were attentive and would check on us often. Food came out pretty quick. So there was no complaints on our side.

Order = 4/5

Fish sauce wings: 5/5
Usually I am afraid of fish sauce because of two things: 1) super salty and 2) irritates my lips. However both were not the case for when we ate these wings. They were salty but not unbearable. They had a nice sticky yet crunchy exterior, and still juicy interior. The size of the wings were also good not like other wing places which seem to find wings from tiny chickens.

Thai tea with evaporated milk: 3/5
I like my Thai tea more on the heavy creamy side (similar to how pho restaurants make it), so this wasn't a big hit with me. I can see it for people who like less heavy cream and more on the tea flavor.

Papaya salad: 4/5
This was my boyfriend's request and he really enjoyed it. It came with a fish sauce dressing that complemented the salad well. The salad itself had strips of papaya in it. Overall it was refreshing and fresh which balanced out the fried aspects of the wings we ordered.

Overall = 4/5
The place had a nice set up with Whiskey Soda Lounge so it made waiting so much easier. Also I kind of enjoyed the outside seating in the canopy so that was a different kind of experience. The food was yummy, different, and had me looking at fish sauce in a whole new way.

Good thing that Pok Pok is Thai-ish food, right?? 

After carousing about the town with Clover, we decided to head over to Pok Pok and sit outside so we could enjoy the weather. 

It's so boring to say it, but it's true. Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings are rad. Man, they are SO good. I have 3 different kinds of fish sauce in my house at any given moment so I'm a big fan. The wings have a softer breading--due to the generous tossing in the fish sauce...sauce. 

The half chicken is a good size and was easily shared between the two of us; it was tender and moist, but was made even bettah by the dipping sauces (tamarind and something else.) 

I wasn't a real fan of their Thai tea. I was glad that it wasn't crushingly sweet, but the vinegar they add...I wasn't keen on.

I really liked the Pet Pha Lo: Duck leg in brothy richness, including a duck egg. It's reminiscent of hot clay pot. I had it with coconut rice--which is great here. The sticky rice, however, is not how I like sticky rice. I couldn't tolerate the plastic bag taste from the rice being steamed in the plastic bag: Could I get my rice ziploc-taste free, por favor?

The ike's vietnamese fish sauce wings are probably the thing they are best known for. It's similar to like korean fried chicken, but with a heavy dose of fish sauce that makes it even more salty. I personally like salty, but mots of my friends felt like it was too salty. 

The papaya pok pok is very spicy, so much so that my gf who loves spicy also had trouble eating it. 

The baby back ribs that we ordered never came. Instead we got some noodle dish that had some pork and shrimp instead. We were craving more meat and received more carbs. This was a HUGE disappointment.

FOOD
Kaeng Hang Leh - This tastes just like my aunt's pork belly dish.  As a kid, this was one of the dishes I most looked forward to having whenever I visited Taiwan.  At Pok Pok, you get a decent sized bowl filled less than halfway with delicious, dark brown, sweet sauce and then 5 pieces of very tender pork belly. It tasted just as good as my aunt's dish, but the main difference is that while hers would have mounds of meat, you only get 5 pieces here.  

Kung Op Wun Sen - Clay pot filled with bean thread noodles, thin slices of pork belly, and shrimp with the shell still on them. This tasted exactly as you'd expect from the description.  I'm not a huge fan of shelling shrimp.

The food is served on these steel plates that make these ""nails-on-a-chalkboard"" screeching sounds with the cutlery, and the lack of ventilation inside the main dining area means your hair will pick up all the smells inside the restaurant.

The wife and I felt like we entering an exclusive club, where only those with the most endurance would win. It was a 1.5 hour wait for this gem, but well worth it! We started with a half-dozen uber-fresh oysters recommended by the waitress from their very descriptive menu. We continued with a mildly spicy and saffron-ny cioppino and the much-vaunted lobster roll. 

The cioppino was excellent. There was a nice variety of meaty mussels, some large and succulent shrimp, and really fresh clams sitting in a very fragrant and slightly thick broth and a pile of risotto. It was both hearty and light and refreshing at the same time. Awesome!

Jenny--

There is very little seating here, but because Neptune Oyster came highly recommended, we roamed the neighborhood to kill the time. 

The lobster roll was the most expensive and best I had on our entire New England tour. We ordered the cold one with mayo. They just piled on the sweet lobster meat. Boy did I love biting into each succulent piece. The bread was nicely toasted too. I also really enjoyed the the cioppino. The mild spiciness really made it stand out from the rest.

I'd say probably one of the best seafood restaurant I've been. And here's why.

We went there on the last day of our trip to Boston, we arrived there at about 2 pm, the place was packed full with customers, but I see most of them are tourists and they were only having lobster rolls. 

We were told that there's not gonna be more than couple of minutes until we can get a table. Then we sat down at the very corner of the restaurant.

The server greet us with a big smile and warm welcome, and patiently explained every questions I had on the menu. I have to say they are truly a seafood specialist. The whole menu's got a HUGE variety of seafood you can choose from and we grabbed ourselves some oysters, crab claws, octopus cocktails, crab cocktails.

I like Neptune oysters for their consistently great oysters and friendly and attentive service despite being always busy in a small space. 
That being said, the last time I went to Neptune was over a year ago, always deterred by the thought of waiting in a long line. 

Luckily we were seated at a bar within 10-15 minutes of checking in around 1pm on a cloudy Tuesday of May. The average wait this time of the day seems to vary widely - we sat at the outer edge of the bar (great seats with the view of the street without getting too crowded with people coming in) and saw locals and tourists coming in in groups of 2-4, with estimated wait quoted as anywhere between 15-60 minutes. A tip from Neptune staffs - the best time to come is between 3-5 pm, almost never a wait, which I guess isn't a surprise. 

Enough about difficulties getting the seats at Neptune, and moving onto the food. 

We started with oysters. They have standard New England oysters from ME and RI (and PEI), and a few selection from the west coast. We went with two ME, one RI, and two West Coast oysters and every single one of them was perfectly fresh and delicious. 

Our hot starter was the Johnny cake - if you haven't had it yet I recommend trying it. It's like a honey buttered pancake with smoked sturgeon and caviar spread on top.  An excellent balance of sweet and salty note in a comforting buttery heaven. 

I was perfectly happy at this point, and while our meal took a significant downhill from here but I still left happy and full. 

After eyeing the PEI mussels, as it's very hard for me not to order mussels in a reputable seafood restaurant, we opted for the Tuesday special, sea urchin ditalini. I love good sea urchin and I would try almost anything with sea urchin. It was described to us as elbow pastas smothered in sea urchin butter with sweet pees which is prepared similar to carbonara sauce. Disappointingly it was a very unremarkable and watery dish. Had I not been sitting in the Neptune oyster bar and happy on oysters and Sam Adams honey IPA, I might have thought this is an acceptable pasta dish for a dinky college or hospital cafeteria. I might be too harsh here, but I could not taste any sea urchin in the dish, overpowered by bacon swimming in watery carbonara-like sauce. 

The last item of the lunch was hot buttered lobster roll. I always feel obligated to try signature lobster rolls in the most popular places in NYC, boston, and other cities I visit, but I admit it's hard for me to feel blown away even with a perfectly fine lobster roll. Here at Neptune they do hot (with butter) and cold (with mayo) versions, and my boyfriend suggested trying the hot lobster roll instead of the usual mayo based cold one. It was okay, a hot buttery bun full of plump lobster meat, but again I wasn't super impressed and next time I'm here I'll order other items on the menu before ordering a lobster roll. But that may be just me not being a fan of lobster rolls in general. 

The service was very friendly, attentive and prompt, which makes it a perfect weekday lunch spot.",5bAJVv1mbF3FArm5jDmM2w,63 Salem St,"Arabian, Thai, American (Traditional), Live/Raw Food, Bars, Soup, Nightlife, Seafood, Restaurants",Boston,42.363237100000006,-71.055975,Neptune Oyster,02113,5115,4.5,MA,1

A great place for the oyster lover as they offer a sushi like oyster menu with many local options, and the freshest and best from both coasts of the US (and sometimes Canada too). The oysters are expensive but if you're willing to splurge they are amongst the best prepared in the city of Boston. Menu items that are favorites are the Warm Lobster Roll (incredible) with poached butter and my personal favorite is the Burger... For an oyster place this burger seems to come out of nowhere but it gives ever burger in this fair city a run for its money.

I must say that this restaurant served probably the best seafood I've ever had in my life.  

My husband got there last night (on a wet October Wednesday night) at 8 pm.  It was an hour wait, so they took down our phone number and we walked over to Mike's to actually have a little dessert first.

Right at about 9 pm when we were gonna get seated, a guy walked in and said he had a group of 3.  The host/server told him that they were full for the night.  Poor guy! He walked away looking so sad.

At the bar, we saw a couple who ordered the grilled lobster, which looked amazing.  It was probably a 10 - 12 inch pan (like a round pizza pan) of grilled lobster in its shell, veggies, and clams.  It looked amazing.  But when we sat down and asked about ordering the $50 treat, they said they were out for the night. :(

So I asked our server what other goodies she recommended.  She said the cioppino is really good - lots of seafood and rice that was spicy like New Orleans cookin'.  So my husband jumped on that, since we love spicy food.

And boy was it amazing!  There were about 3 types of fish on our plate (about 2 inch pieces), 2 big fresh plump shrimp, 2 plump clams, lobster pieces, and rice soaking in really good broth that was actually spicy!  We were in heaven.  I even asked for spoons so that we could drink the broth/sauce with our food.  I was amazed at how plump and juicy both the shrimp and clams were (the shrimp was firm and crunchy, which is a sign of freshness!).  The fish were good too. 

I've had lobster rolls up and down the coast of Maine and even at the famous Red's Eats (supposedly the best lobster roll in Maine).  I liked the roll at Red's, but found that my lobster would've been SO much better had it been hot instead of cold to dip into my warm butter.  The lobster was really good, but cold.  It was a bit disappointing.

So last night, I ordered a hot lobster roll.  It was amazing!  The bun was toasted and buttered on the inside and outside.  I had to eat it with a knife and fork, since it was so buttery.  The lobster was sweet, hot, and evenly buttered.  They were cut up into small pieces that were evenly buttered, though not dripping.  It was so perfect, and the pieces of lobster tasted amazing, even without the bread!

And I forgot to mention that we ordered a few oysters off the check list they gave us before our meal.  The descriptions of the taste of the oysters were right on!  One of the ones I got was the one that was sweet, creamy, and had the honeydew melon aftertaste.  It was by far the best oyster I've ever had!  Very plump, sweet, juicy, and creamy.  They were extremely fresh and tasted clean.

Just a hint, try your oysters with just a squirt of lemon juice instead of putting all that other stuff they give you on it.  I'm bit of a purist about some foods, and I like to taste the food and not cover it in sauces.  A squirt of lemon juice was just enough to let me taste the oyster and all its flavors.  If you're getting great quality oysters, skip the sauces and use just lemon juice to really taste the flavors (which is what you're paying for anyway).  

Our whole meal was about $100 with tax and tip.  But my husband remarked on our way out that it was worth every penny.  When I go back again, I wanna try the lobster grill.  If not, the cioppino would be at the top of my list since it was SO good!",hxFuK5yfhvXTutTF76QtUQ,63 Salem St,"Arabian, Thai, American (Traditional), Live/Raw Food, Bars, Soup, Nightlife, Seafood, Restaurants",Boston,42.363237100000006,-71.055975,Neptune Oyster,02113,5115,4.5,MA,1

It is certainly better than an all you can eat buffet so it wasn't terrible  but at these prices it should be better than Legal Seafood or Mccormick & Schmick in terms of freshness and shucking. Of the 8 varieties I tried, I can only say the pemiquids were good. Rest had very little brine and had shell fragments while some didn't even have the underside cut so I found myself trying to dislodge the meat with my oyster fork. The condiments also did not taste homemade and they looked & tasted off so I stuck with the lemons.

Additional notes: their signature dish, the lobster roll which my two neighbors at the bar ordered looked rubbery and unappetizing. My neighbor on the right actually complained to the waitress it had way too much butter which apparently she had asked them to cut down on. I thought the waitress was pretty dismissive & rude to the customer & I can't help but feel it was due in part to the customer's poor English.

i loved the selection of oysters along with the little descriptions of where they are from, their size and flavor.

i have nothing more to say about the oysters. they were fresh and plump. period. 

The clam chowder was surprisingly light for a cream based soup. There were plenty of clams and not alot of fillers like potatoes and veggies. Also, it wasnt thick and starchy like the ones ive had before. it had a nice clammy, lightly creamy, delicious flavor. 

We ordered the lobster roll hot and buttered. They were huge chunks of lobster on a hot buttered roll with a side of fries. each lobster piece was succulent, chewy, and flavorful.

We lucked out and slid in on a Sunday afternoon around 5:00pm, no wait, corner seat away from the traffic and front door. Our location made it possible for us to scope out what others were ordering and while everything looked fantastic, the lobster roll is obviously the star here. I saw some Cioppino and hamburgers coming out of the kitchen as well. The place is small and the servers hustle, but we were VERY well taken care of. 

We started with 6 oysters and ended up ordering another 6. It's surprisingly easy to knock back a dozen oysters and they were all magical. We had a few drinks while waiting for our entrees, lobster roll and the Sunday special fish tacos. The fish tacos, while pricey at $26 are obscenely sized and good! Theres no way to eat them as tacos with the amount of fish they serve, but that didn't bother me. The pico/slaw is the best pico/slaw ever. I make a lot of pico at home and never thought to mix it with slaw but it's brilliant and I'm stealing that idea. The cabbage brings a nice texture to the pico and when paired with the fish it was simply delightful. The lobster roll is every bit as good as it should be with the Yelp reputation Neptune has. We opted for the lobster roll served hot with butter rather than cold. This is a no nonsense lobster roll, it's a pile of lobster on a toasted buttered roll and there aren't many things better. The 2lbs of french fries that accompany the lobster roll were also great. 

Would I have enjoyed this place as much if I had to wait 2 hours? Hard to say for sure, but probably.

The service was great, I had the same bartender both time and he had perfect recommendations for both food and drink. I was not a big oyster person before I stepped foot in Neptune; however I can't say the same anymore. They have an incredible variety of raw bar options.

We went family style. Shared everything so that everyone got a taste, $50 per person. Every dish was delicious. 

Buttermilk Jonnycake: Pancake-like bottom with tasty tartare. A mix of slightly sweet and savory. Easy to share.

PEI Mussels: The curry was so yum and spicy that we kept asking for more bread and alternating dips between the curry and the clam chowder

Clam chowder: More like ""clam cream soup"". I agree with others here, this was no chowder, but it was still ok. Good to share as it comes in more of a bowl size than cup size

Hamachi Ceviche Crudo: Raw fish, fun sauce. Do it.

Flash seared nantucket yellowfin tuna: Tuna melts in your mouth, and the salad and light light dressing and light 'mashed potatoes' complement each other

Greek Whole Fish: Dont' get this if you can't de-bone a fish. We skillfully removed the spine and fins and dug in. Fresh, light, tasty while fish came with some meaty mushrooms and cooked kale greens. It all tasted good together.

Lobster roll: Buttery deliciousness. I barely even like lobster and enjoyed this. I would have found it overwhelming if I'd had to eat it alone, however.

Oysters: Each person ordered 3, all very good, fresh, no sand. They give you a dim sum like card where you mark how many of each you want. 

Service was also good. Waters were full (even though it's hard to gracefully reach some of them), and whenever we asked for bread/a drink/ another dish, they obliged. 
When we ordered, we just said ""the Tuna"" and at first, we were brought the tuna appetizer. We mentioned that we had ordered the entree, and they kindly took it back and did not charge us, given that the ordering was unclear.

The clam chowder is a light, slightly creamy chowder with really fresh clams and potatoes that don't fall apart. It comes in a relatively large bowl that if you paired it with some smaller items, you'd be just fine.

Oysters are THE BEST in Boston.  Better than Island Creek, better than B&G.  I am judging based on shucking quality (no shells, no dirt), temperature of the oysters, pricing, selection/variety (they had one from NZ, which is really cool), and overall quality/taste of the oysters.  Hands down the best.

Lobster roll is also the best in Boston - I'm only talking about the hot one.  Never had their cold version, but after I get that I'll rate again.  But ever since I had their hot lobster roll, I want to dump hot clarified butter on EVERY lobster roll I get.  I'm hooked.  Share it with someone; it's so filling.

When I went to Neptune Oyster it was for my cousin's b-day and while there are a few complaints about location and spacing the food was better than anywhere else in Boston. 

It is in the North End of Boston so there is no parking and theres so much traffic you shoudlnt even think about driving. The place is also pretty packed so be sure to call for a reservation or be ready for wait for half an hour. 

That being said, the food we had that night was terrific,

1. Fried Clams - delicious and not greasy, full of flavour 
2. Clam Chowder - not your thick tasteless clam chowder but a full body chowder which is light and packed with clams - best chowder Ive ever had
3. Lobster Roll - $27 and worth every dollar, the roll itself is huge, with a whole lobster packed into it. Your choice of butter or mayo (I went with butter) and it was just.... delicious (not like those crappy lobster rolls at fanueil hall and much better quality than Kellys)

The oyster selection spans way beyond the ubiquitous Wellfleet, Kumamoto, Blue Point, Malpeque repetoire at every other raw bar.  While fresh lemon, mignonette and cocktail sauce are offered, the quality and freshness of these sea gems requires nothing.

The icy cold Peroni on tap (this is the North End, yah?) was a lovely compliment on a hot day.

I had a little sticker shock when I ordered the lobster roll ($25?! For something on a hot dog bun?!), but all was forgiven when I took my 
first bite. There could well have been an entire hot, buttery, perfect lobster unloaded into the oversized bun.  

The decor matched the food, in that it was comfortably casual, but elegant at the same time. It is a small place dominated by a big marble topped bar. (I love eating at the bar and people watching.) The staff is attentive without being pushy. It was just well-executed the whole way around.

The environment is a nice laid back upscale combo. A little loud inside (which I don't mind) as almost half of the place is a bar. 

There is seating for up to 24 at the tables, so the max you'll ever see is 40-50 people in the establishment at any given time.

Went here for a going away dinner for someone at work. Started at the bar because we were waiting for one person to show up. I think it may have been a good thing. Ordered up some raw bar goodies and wine. The oysters and raw clams were delicious. You order them on a sushi-style sheet which has accurate descriptions of the distinctive flavors of each oyster. If you need more info, the staff is super knowledgeable about the oysters. We each ordered wine by the glass. They have an extensive ""by the glass"" list and the staff is also super knowledgeable about the wines. And this was only the beginning...

When seated, we split two apps at the table--the fried clams were light and delicious, but the salt cod salad stole the show. In addition to salt cod, the salad also had some crispy lamb and pancetta, so delicious! The menu here was quite creative--combos of ingredients that you never would think of and may sound a bit weird, but somehow turn out amazing. I picked cod again for my entree. It was cooked up with an artichoke crust, served over whipped potatoes with a berry, smoked mussel and citrus salad. I ate every last bite of this, and would have licked the plate if I wasn't out at a nice restaurant with folks I work with. The other most memorable dish of the night was the sturgeon, which was served up with black currant caviar  jam and a plum graham cracker panzanella--the coworkers couldn't stop raving about it.

The place is small and they don't take reservations, so I recommend that you go early. Also, it is a bit pricey, particularly if you want to sample lots of oysters.

We went in at ~5 and they still had seats available, but we weren't hungry yet. We were told to come back a little later and put our names down, so that's what we did.

It was POURING outside, but the hostess called and told us a table was ready. We braved the rain for it. Totally worth it. 
The hostesses and waitresses are so friendly and welcoming. 
A tried 6 different oysters. We also ordered the buttermilk johnnycake, and I had the monkfish. Monkfish - huge portions and delicious! It was too much though. The first bite was AMAZING!

I finally got the chance to check this place out!! The restaurant is tiny... so if you come here during prime time lunch or dinner hours expect to wait at least an hour! Luckily, when we got here we just avoided the line. There was one open table to seat us and after that I kept hearing the waiter say ""45min-1hr wait"" for the people who came right after us.

So we ordered a bunch of different types of oysters and clams as well as the Hot Lobster Roll. Surprisingly, our raw stuff took so long to come out.... It took about 30 minutes for the oysters and clams to get to our table. Raw food shouldn't take this long to be served!!! Our waiter probably saw our frustrated and hungry faces and noticed that our raw bar food had yet to be served. He quickly gave us a free appetizer. It was Hamachi Sashimi served with avocado spread. It was delicious and made me hungrier!

The raw items were FINALLY served to us and were quickly devoured. Clams were meaty, juicy, and sweet and oysters were sweet and creamy. They were super fresh! Definitely worth trying even though they are super expensive.

The hot lobster rolls were amazing. I did NOT expect SO MUCH LOBSTER. Usually, places skim on the lobster when making a roll by mixing it with a bunch of mayo and completely chopping the lobsters until you cannot tell whether or not its lobster that you're eating. Not this place! There was big ass lobster chunks perfectly placed in between a slightly grilled bun. All of that is coated with melted butter and served with some amazing fries. $25 well spent!.",U-blmCm_qUbibUUgqDSB_g,63 Salem St,"Arabian, Thai, American (Traditional), Live/Raw Food, Bars, Soup, Nightlife, Seafood, Restaurants",Boston,42.363237100000006,-71.055975,Neptune Oyster,02113,5115,4.5,MA,1

I've been twice, last spring and this past Monday to have an almost identical meal. Sometimes, I revisit the meal mentally--yum. Here's the rundown:

Atmosphere: Tiny--fits about 12 at the bar and maybe 30 more in restaurant, but they do that great thing where they take your cell number and call you when space opens up. There's a cozy coffee shop a few doors down that you can wait at. The restaurant itself has a bit of an at the docks feel decorated with posters of various kinds of fish. 

Oysters: first place I tasted oysters and now hooked. The raw bar has both local and those from father afield. Sitting at the bar you can watch them shuck the oysters and watch passerbys peer into the restaurant to stare at them. Fresh and served with lemon and a cocktail sauce topped with a bit of garlic in truffle oil--yum.

Neptune on Piggyback: fried oysters topping pork belly. The whole meal was so not kosher, but so, so delicious. 

Scallops: delicious scallops-perfectly seared on the outside. They come on a base of potato puree topped with a bed of brussels sprouts, chanterelles, and some more pork belly. 

Lobster Roll: get it hot with butter--it practically melts in your mouth. This is the lobster roll to measure others by. 

The previous time I went, we had the clams as well, brought on accident, which they comped. Also, delicious. 

Only negatives: no dessert (sad) and longish wait times (the 36 hours in Boston NYTimes article may have made it worse, but I did get seated immediately last time--at 6:30 on Monday night).

After sitting down at the bar, the bartender informs us that the waiter wanted to buy us each a glass of prosecco for moving - sweet...definitely feeling better now.

The rest of the meal was delicious. We ordered some oysters and the shrimp cocktail from the raw bar. Although the shrimp cocktail was actually only one shrimp...it was huge and really meaty. We then split the clam chowder and the dinner special that night (a whole fried bass with mexican style rice and beans, guacamole, and fried plantains).

The uni toast was very, very good. Two slices of bread with a generous spread of sea urchin butter = party in your mouth. This one was well worth the money.

We started with a combination of a dozen east and west coast oysters.  They were fresh, well prepared and delicious - everything you would expect from a quality oyster bar.

My friend had the North End Ciopinno - lots of fish and seafood, in a very tasty and somewhat spicy broth.  We'd highly recommend all of the dishes.  Neptune has a pretty good drink list, and you'll likely be able to find something that pairs well with whatever you decide to eat. 

So with all of the positive things out of the way, here are a few things to be aware of: 

- Get there early or pick an off-peak time to visit.  The day we were able to successfully get a seat we still waited two hours.

Saturday afternoon 4 pm - line out the door and when I had called an hour earlier, was told they don't do take-out at all on Saturdays.  No desire to wait an hour in the pouring rain, so went 45 minutes earlier on Sunday before they opened.  We were the first ones in and of course got the lobster sandwich.  We got it hot with the butter and it was delicious and huge compared to most lobster sandwich places.  We had enough left to take home and share with a friend who is a lobster afficionado and she said it was the best lobster she had ever had.  

However, the best part of the meal was not the lobster roll, it was actually their CHEESEBURGER.  Friend who ordered it couldn't eat seafood at the time, but my eyes were rolling when she ordered it.  When it came out though, we each took one bite and were shocked how a lobster and seafood place could make such a good burger.  Half the price of the lobster sandwich, juicy, plump, delicious, high quality meat -- simply the best burger in Boston that I've had.

It was one of my first dates with my now boyfriend and he took me out for dinner for my birthday. We started off at the bar at Neptune's, like I said, arriving there around 9:15 after he got out of work, had some champagne and ordered some oysters. YOU WOULD THINK AT THIS POINT AND SMART PERSON IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS WOULD SAY ""THE KITCHEN CLOSES IN 10 MINUTES, PLACE AN ORDER NOW' So that he would at least if anything, being the seemingly SELFISH prick he was, do that so he could get a better tip, but NO he let us sit there basking in new love and sipping champagne and oysters until 9:35 when we decided to place an order. FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE CLOSED HE WOULD NOT TAKE AN ORDER, yes I understand, it was a Sunday, but there were many other tables there that hadn't gotten their food yet, and the kitchen was still cooking. It isn't like it was dead in there and they all were just watching us to hurry up and go. Not to mention, the raw bar is opened later than the kitchen, so the bartender still would have had to stay there.. 

I was so upset and angered by the fact that all the bartender had to do was warn us as opposed to just prancing around the bar incompetently doing nothing, that i wanted to scream profanities at him, but refrained b.c I didn't want to scare of the new BF. 

So now, on my soap box I am telling the jerk of a bartender ""I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU AND I HATE YOU!"" I will not ever return to that place, ever. Sadly, for you, I live in the N.

I would suggest taking a lead from Jason Bond @Bondir, who, along with his staff, shows that exceptional food can be served in a humble and respectful manner.

The lobster rolls are so delicious and much better served hot instead of cold because to me,  I don't taste much of the lobster and instead mostly mayo.  So I 100% recommend getting a hot butter lobster roll if you are having trouble deciding with which to go with because it gives you a chance to enjoy and savor the luscious lobster meat! The clam chowder was also really good but it was just a bit too runny for me.  When I think of chowder,  I think thick and creamy and although it had great flavor and tender clams, just wasn't the consistency I desired. The reason I gave it 4 Stars was because since it's always packed, the door is constantly being left open with people waiting and It gets freezing while you're eating.  The waitress did her best to accommodate her tables as well as control the amount the door was being opened AND phone calling people to let them know there's a table ready.

It's small and ridiculously touristy, so be prepared to come early to line up. As in if you want to eat at 8pm, come at 5pm...because that's what we did for our table of 6.

Memorable Orders:

Clam Chowder ($11) -The chowder is runny, like a slightly reduced cream. But the flavour profile is definitely impressive. Settled on the bottom of the soup are lots of cooked clams, potatoes, and other treasures. It's a good bowl of soup, but not the best chowder in the traditional sense.

Maine Lobster Roll ($25) -This was definitely the best part of the meal. The lobster is served chunky instead of ground up, giving that good succulent seafood texture. Drizzled with warm butter and a soft roll, it is to die for!

Cod ($35) - If you happen to come here on a Saturday, the cod is the special of the day which isn't on the regular menu. My advice? ORDER IT. I don't normally like cod but this was was a pleasant surprise. The fish was flakey and light at the touch of a fork, while still being firm when you bite through it. A nice light entree.

Not-so-memorable Orders:

Dayboat Scallop Crudo ($12) -For $12, this Dayboat Scallop Crudo was definitely underwhelming. Barely sharable, and it wasn't anything to write home about. 

Neptunes on Piggyback ($13) -crispy oysters, Berkshire pig, golden raisin confiture, pistachio aioli. It's a little bit of a confusing dish. You don't really know what you are tasting, but all the flavours and textures do work.

Covered in subway tiles with a long bar that spans the length of the restaurant, there's always a wait for a table, a buzz in the air, and a scene-y energy that makes me feel like I'm back in New York. I prefer a seat at the bar and a pint of a local brew, while scanning that evening's oyster list. There are plenty of local bivalves and beers on tap, but Neptune also flies in West Coast oysters...my personal fave.

Start with a smattering of oyster selects and then move on to crudo; I tried both the hamachi ceviche with jalapeno-lime vinaigrette and the dayboat scallops with local apple marmalade...equally on point. The plated menu items are generously portioned and genuinely prepared with seasonal ingredients you can feel good about. The fare is ""elevated seafood shack"" featuring: fried Ipswich clams, buttermilk johnnycakes with smoked trout tartare and caviar, whole fish grilled a la plancha, and their signature dish, your choice of a hot butter or cold mayo Maine lobster roll served with french fries.

My most recent visit here was with my sister and we came on a Thursday evening so it was fairly easy to get a seat compared to the weekend (the time before that I came with my fiance and we waited at least 2 hours to get seated!). So the bottom line with reservations is come early, especially on Friday-Sunday, and at least put your name down so they can call you when a table is ready because they are a small, yet incredibly busy joint. 

So this may come as a shock, but I actually do not like raw oysters. Yes, roll your eyes and be disgusted with me, but I just never got into them. With that, you may ask, ""So Kevin what do you order when you're there?"" Hot lobster roll that's what. Even the first time I came here I didn't really eat lobster, but slowly but surely my fiance opened my eyes to the deliciousness of these ocean dwellers. The lobster rolls here are the bomb and I've had several other ones in Bar Harbor, Maine. The amount of lobster you get is fantastic and when you throw the flavors in there you just have the perfect combination of quantity and quality. 

It is decently priced, but if you like lobster rolls then you'll like this one.

All I can say is that if I were on death row, the hot lobster roll here is a top contender for my last meal ever - it's that good! The lobster is generously buttered & piled high on a roll. The roll soaks up all that flavorful goodness & pretty much because butter with a side of bread. But the lobster is the main attraction. The chunks are huge & you get a ton of that tender sweet sweet lobster. Ahh, I'm drooling just thinking about it!! At $25 a pop, it might be offensive to your wallet, but once your taste buds have at it, you will not mind paying a mountain of gold for a lobster roll. 

The oysters here are amazing as well! They have so many varieties & describe each of them based on size, texture, saltiness, and finish. I felt like I learned so much about oysters the two times I came here in two days. That's right, i loved it so much I went twice in two days!

The place is small & can get packed all day long, so I suggest getting there early, putting your name on the wait list (they call you when it's your turn to be seated) & just wander around the North End, even explore some of the Freedom Trial while you wait to work up your appetite.

We both ordered a bowl of the clam chowder and a lobster roll. The clam chowder had great flavor, but the texture was too watery for my liking. The crackers were also way too hard (stale?) and overpowered the chowder. I'm glad I only tried one.

The lobster roll, on the other hand, was so freaking amazing! It's the best lobster roll I had the entire week I was in Boston, hands down. Probably the best lobster roll I've ever had.

We arrived at 5pm and it was already full with an hour wait. There's no bar to wait at. There's not even room right inside the door to wait. They put you on a list and take your cell number to text/call when it's your turn to enter heaven. It allows you to wander the North End looking at shops, have a cocktail, etc. That's civilized. I've always wondered why most restaurants don't do that. Finally somebody listened to my prayers!

You will be packed in shoulder to shoulder with other patrons. I didn't like that part. The air conditioning couldn't keep the place cooled appropriately.

We were seated at the bar facing the window on the street. That made for some great people watching while we waited for our food. The drawback was that it put us next to the door and folks would stand there for long periods of time holding it open letting out precious air condition. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed it just a bit when people wandered in and were told it was two plus hours wait while we already had seats.

They have a great selection of oysters, crab claws, etc. We picked about 14 or so. They were all fresh and prepared perfectly. No broken shells, clean shells, the muscle was fully detached, etc. The guy prepping them was right in front of us and we watched him discard several oysters if he broke the shell or made any minor mistake.

My cioppino was very good as well and contained quite a bit of seafood. It looks kinda small at first, but in the end it turns out to definitely be enough food. The service was fine for such a fast paced place. I can't say that it was stellar by any means, but it was more than acceptable for a place of this size with epic wait times. Overall, the food was 5 stars and the service was good enough to not drag it down...so that is 5 yelp stars in my book.",42Szf3cSz41nn-vcbtlfXg,63 Salem St,"Arabian, Thai, American (Traditional), Live/Raw Food, Bars, Soup, Nightlife, Seafood, Restaurants",Boston,42.363237100000006,-71.055975,Neptune Oyster,02113,5115,4.5,MA,1

As a chef, I could tell he was the owner.. You just can sense it by their attitude/way they carry themselves. So I thought, great! Well... This is where I was wrong!! He was the worst.. 

I had to beg for water 2x, he let our oysters sit on the counter.. 2 feet from us.. Read the ticket.. And left them there. The waitress came by 5 min later.. Read the ticket and handed it to us. We were siting at the bar.. And if you've been here.. It's not that big!! And he was right in front of us!

We ordered dinner, he took my order, but we had to flag him down to take my co-workers order.. Mind you.. We were both there.. Waiting with menus. 

When it came time to pay the bill.. What a nightmare.. He took forever. 

My co-worker said, ""well.. I guess that's why he's the bartender."" And I replied, ""no, because it didn't look like he cared about tips like most bar staff do.. This guy.. Is the owner."" Sure enough.. I was correct.. And he was a major di*khole.

Food was great, some of the most tender octopus I've ever eaten, and I've been to 30% of the world in traveling, cooking, and eating.

As an entree I had the cioppino which was finger licking good, although a little on the salty side - and I don't mind salt. However, the langostinos were very fresh and the rice was perfectly cooked, which is a little tough to pull off with this dish.

The fries were fresh cut and some of the best fries we've had in a while.  Every fry off the 3 lobster roll plates was eaten. 

The clam chowder was a little disappointing.  Too watery for me.  Not enough cream and richness to the broth even though there were huge clams in the chowder.

The steamed clams with white wine, garlic and parsley was refreshing.  The sauce was tasty.  We could have eaten several orders of these. 

I was a little disappointed with the raw oyster and clams.  They were good no doubt but not as good as Legal Sea Foods.  It was nothing special but I think that is probably due to my preference for the smaller west coast oysters.  We tried some of the local oysters and this just isn't my favorite type.

We really wanted to eat here since we had heard so many good things about it. Fun Fact, many celebrities like Mark Walhberg and Justin Timberlake have eaten here! 

The Food: Their oysters are a MUST! We ordered the Island Creek, Katama Bay, Mookie Blue, and Kumamoto Oysters. My favorite was the Island Creek ones, but the others were also really good. Who knew that eating oysters could be so fancy? The menu listed salinity, size, and even a special remark about each oyster!  Also, who knew oysters could taste like fruits? The Kumamoto had an interesting Honeydew aftertaste to it. 

For Appetizers, we ordered the Well Fleet Clam Chowder and Yellowfin Coyne Crostini (Tuna Tartare). The clam chowder is made fresh to order and is very generous with portions of clam. It was definitely one of the best clam chowders I've ever had! Most restaurants made the mistake of adding to much salt, but the one here is perfect. The Tuna Tartare was also very fresh and came with a piece of bruschetta bread.

The oysters are fresh and delicious but expect to be shoulder to shoulder with other diners.  It's not a spot for a quiet, romantic dinner but rather a fun night out spent sitting at the wine bar and enjoying the seafood.  Last night, a rainy Tuesday evening, we sauntered in around 7pm and were fortunate to find a nearly deserted bar.  The bartender quickly took our drink orders - favorites from the beer & wine list that we've discovered on other visits -  a glass of the Pigato white wine for me (a delicious Italian light, dry white) and a Whale's Tale Pale Ale for my husband.  A few oysters followed.  Our tried and true favorite is the Island Creek which we mixed with 2 less familiar names.  Neptune serves what is fresh and in season so there is always a new mollusk  to sample.  After drooling over it on other visits, my husband had the Neptuneburger and was it delicious.  Served on a brioche bun and topped with a fried oyster and garlic aoli, it's filling and I was lucky to have a quarter of it land on my plate!

Thatch Island, MA (buttery, light briny taste)
Bluepoint, CT (smooth)
Taylor Bay, MA (overly salty)
Pemaquid, ME (zesty)
Ninigret, RI (lightly salty)
Fanny Bay, BC (melon flavor, cucumber finish)

The Fanny Bay oysters took the cake with their standout, layered flavor that transitioned well from beginning to end.  In fact, I'd say it beats out the lauded Kumamotos for my top pick.  I had some white to go with the midday snack and I continue to be thoroughly impressed with their selections by the glass:

Puiatti, Chardonnay 'Zuccole', Fruili, 2009 (mild butter notes, full body, dry finish)
Gramona, Muscat 'Gessami', Penedes, 2008 (medium body, mild sweetness, honey and lemon notes)

1) Neptune's is a tiny, tiny place that seats about 30 so wait or put you name down to be called back.  If you're smarter, you'd call weeks in advance to get a reservation (if they take them).  We put our name down, walked around, snacked on some cannolis and about 3 hours later, received a call back and were glad we came in.

2) Order the oysters.  Any of them.  All of them. They are fresh and you kind of have to feel sorry for the shucker because of how many they have to shuck, but still, order them.

Very crowded, so get here early, and then expect to go wander the streets of Boston or hang out at a bar somewhere to wait for them to call you when your seat is ready.  (Excellent choice by the way, instead of forcing people to wait around outside the restaurant).

Sat down and ordered up a slew of oysters to try, two lobsters rolls (one hot, one cold), Neptune's on Piggback, and Clam Chowder.  Here's the word:

Clam Chowder:  Excellent flavor, very fresh tasting ingredients from the clams to the potatoes and herbs.  A bit watery for my tastes (probably because I grew up on thick creamy Campbells like 95% of the US population), but even with the wateriness, there was no lacking in flavor.  

Neptune's on Piggyback - Oh lordy, this was good... perfectly fried oysters on well made pork with golden raisins and pistachio aioli.  This is some fine dining... my only regrets are that I had to share this with my friend, and that there wasn't more when we licked the plate clean.

Oysters and clams:  We ordered up a selection of Katama Bay, Bees River, Kumomoto, Kusshi, Little Necks, and Cherrystones.  All were excellent, fresh and delicious... stand outs were the Kumomoto (large and good flavor), as well as the Katama Bays.  

Lobster Rolls:  The main course... we dove into the cold (mayo based) and hot (garlic oil based) and compared the two.  Maybe it was the slightly chilled rainy day, but I preferred the hot with the warm garlic oil softening the nicely toasted bread.  Both were excellent, the lobsters were cooked perfectly tender, and very enjoyable.  $25 worth?  I'm not fully convinced... you'll have to decide that for yourself... but definitely the best lobster roll I've had to date.

Verdict:  If you've got time in Boston and don't 'mind a little wait, definitely worth checking out for the raw bar, the Neptune on Piggyback, and potentially the lobster roll.  I would love to go back for raw bar and Neptune on Piggyback alone, and still undecided about the lobster roll.

I agree with other reviews that have noted slow service and high prices. But here's the thing--I don't mind long lunches or dinners (in some circumstances) and I definitely don't mind paying high prices for fabulous food. Granted, I won't go regularly since I'm living on a grad school budget, but for a splurge, it's great. 

First tip: if you sit at the bar, things tend to move a little faster. You're right in front of them so there's no ignoring an empty dish or glass.

Second tip: Even if you're not a huge fan of eating an entire meal full of raw seafood (like I do), Neptune Oyster has wonderful alternatives for you--particularly their daily specials in the corner of the menu. I sampled my boyfriend's fish and chips (he's one of those who doesn't live off raw seafood) and it was honestly the best I've ever had. It was an ACTUAL filet of fish instead of those pathetic pieces they normally fry up for fish and chips. It was perfectly battered and the fries were awesome. I was really, really surprised that they did such a good job with it.

I've had a various assortment of the oysters they offer plus the clam chowder, hamachi, and a few other random entrees. I'm allergic to lobster and crab--so I can't attest to that myself. I can only repeat rave reviews from my parents when they last came with me.

The oysters are always amazing. Super fresh, absolutely the best quality and always presented well. I order extra kumamodo (sp??) and kusshi. I'm a huge fan of the small, plump oysters that are less briny than the bigger ones. But I'll eat (and appreciate) any oyster. I could literally eat an entire meal of those two oysters alone with a glass of white wine and be the happiest person in the world.

The clam chowder isn't everything I hoped it would be. It has great quality ingredients and the clams are wonderful but the soup was a little thin for me. But that might just be personal preference.

Whatever fabulous sea bass concoction was offered the second time I was there with my boyfriend....oh my god. Insanely delicious. The fish just melted in your mouth. I believe it also came with a polenta that made my day.

Hamachi--always a winner. Beautifully presented and absolutely delicious.

Triton platter--supposedly incredible. My parents split it during my most recent visit and I, sadly, could not partake...but they talked about it through the night and into the next day. The lobster salad was a huge winner, as were the mussels, clams and oysters. The shrimp were HUGE. Oh dear lord were they big. And supposedly also quite good. Needless to say, I was insanely jealous. 

The trick to Neptune Oyster is to not go during extended peak hours. Go for lunch (same menu, smaller crowd) or around 9ish if you can stand a late dinner. Personally, I love long lunches so I love going (when I can, obviously), in the early afternoon and just eating as much as humanly possible. Maybe that's what made the slower table service more acceptable my last visit. It was also only one waitress for the whole restaurant and she tried to be as attentive as possible so I respect her for that. I've also never, ever had a problem with any of the staff at the restaurant. They have always treated me with respect and have been very friendly through the meal.

Final tip: Put your name in when you're not hungry, wander around the great little shops in the area, then indulge when they call you. Don't expect to immediately get in. It's a tiny, tiny restaurant and it's always crowded. But it's crowded for a reason.... So not a place to go on a whim unless it's some weird hour of the day because you'll face a long wait and get cranky.

Maine Lobster roll - a standard and established item at Neptune Oyster. I prefer the hot over the cold.

Even better with the Fisherman's Brew.

A variety of fresh raw oysters with knowledgeable, friendly waitstaff. A helpful order card with informational taste points highlighted. Served with cocktail sauce and mignonette. Some may find this odd but I personally love dipping my fries into the sauces as well.

Tip: do not come hungry because you will usually need to wait a good amount of time; by the time you're up - you'll be starving. I also noticed that It doesn't help to stare at the patrons eating as you're waiting outside (I'm so SO rude). Sit up at the bar if you can.

I, of course, ordered the lobster roll, which was all kinds of delicious.  It was meaty, flavorful, not claw meat, and it was mostly just lobster (and a mini bit of mayo).  The fries were ok, but I was there for the lobster, and I was happy.  It's a bit steep at $25, but hey, it's not every day I get one of these.

My sister had the fish tacos (also delicious).

Service was friendly, and he didn't get flustered when the 2 tables of tourists next to us insisted upon asking questions about every item on the menu and tried to share a lobster roll with 4 people....

Bathrooms - 4 (small and hard to get to)
Value - 3 - pricey!
Food - 5
Service - 4 (moderate attempt to upcharge me on the wine...)
Atmosphere - 4 (a bit touristy...)

Worth a stop, though be prepared to wait (and most likely, you'll be waiting at another bar).",488KrW58ryVduy0Me8DRxg,63 Salem St,"Arabian, Thai, American (Traditional), Live/Raw Food, Bars, Soup, Nightlife, Seafood, Restaurants",Boston,42.363237100000006,-71.055975,Neptune Oyster,02113,5115,4.5,MA,1

They listed 12 oysters on their order sheet so I just ordered one of each to sample all of them.    It should have been around $36 but when I got the bill it said something like ""Dozen Sampler"" $39.  I was just curious about the weird pricing strategy and asked the waiter why is it more expensive to order all 12 oysters together than to order 12 individually, he could not give an explanation.  His manager came by and said that dozen meant baker's dozen so they gave me 13 oysters ... ok ... I only ordered 12 on the order sheet and I thought baker's dozen meant that they'd give you one for free, but that's fine.  Was about to pay when I looked at my phone where I took a picture of the plate of oysters when they brought it out, they actually only served 11.  Not impressed with the game they are playing here.

I don't normally like to eat alone at a restaurant but was alone for this occasion and asked for a seat at the bar (around 6 pm). Hostess said there was a 20 minute wait and that she would call me when a seat was available. Didn't have to wait 10 minutes before I got a call back, so that was a good start. I overheard that the wait was about an hour for a party of 4 at that point.

Ordered three oysters of varying sizes, origins, and tastes to have some variety. They run about $2-3/oyster and all were nice and fresh. I definitely could've eaten a couple more but wanted to save my appetite. BTW, the triton plateau looked tremendous.

Now the clam chowder. I LOVED. Probably my favorite part of the meal. I like my chowder not too heavy and this delivered. Fresh and flavorful with clams you can actually taste. I only wish the bowl were bigger.

And then the Maine lobster roll. Nice, large chunks of lobster meat on a buttered roll with a large heap of fries. It was good but a little too buttery for my taste. Compared to a $15 lobster roll I have had from the Red Hook Lobster Pound, I felt that while you definitely get more bang for your buck the quality was just slightly higher. And the fries were sadly burnt. Maybe if they take that off the order it would be $5 cheaper and then you can leave your stomach room for more oysters...

Service? Ehh. I know I was alone, but the bartender/waitress couldn't really be bothered. I had to wait for her to finish her ""line"" of customers after attempting to order and then saw my order for oysters sitting in front of me for a good five minutes before she delivered it to me. Also the people next to me who ordered after me got some of their food before mine. Normally not really nitpitcky, but we ordered the same thing. So I guess I'll have to dock a star for service.

It was a 20 minute wait, which was over almost as soon as we sat down in a cafe down the street for tea. I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about rude staff, maybe I went on a good day? Everyone was polite, just friendly enough without being overbearing.

To start we got oysters - Kumamoto, Katama Bay, Browne's, Ichabod - 2 of each. Descriptions on the oyster list were spot on. If you're like me, most of your oyster experiences have probably been the large, flat, salty kind. Get the Kumamoto. It's extremely small, low brine, and oh so creamy. The others were more briny, but very clean tasting and great to eat as well. I highly recommend getting the oysters WITHOUT mignonette or cocktail sauce, as both tend to overpower the oysters.

We also got the spanish octopus salad. HUGE chunks of octopus, cooked for a long time till ridiculously tender. The sauce was a bit tart. Vegetables were delightfully sweet.

For entrees, we got the cioppino with lobster and the seared scallops. Cioppino was very tasty, with a pleasant spicy kick and a very generous heap of lobster meat (for only $10 more). No idea what fish they had in the stew but there were 2 kinds, and both were cooked to perfection. The prawns and mussels were nothing special.

Scallops were perfectly cooked with a nice sear. All the other stuff on the plate - duck confit, blue cheese, brussel sprouts - went together very well. The pear butter was slightly sweet and gave everything a nice refreshing lift. The whole dish was extremely well executed.

All in all it came up to roughly $69 each after tip+tax. Well worth every penny.

I tried to push my luck. How busy can this place actually be right? Boy was I wrong... They quoted my time (party of 2) to be 2-2.5 hour wait. I ended up waiting 3 hours. I waited at peet's coffee around the corner.

We got sat at the bar (really wanted a table but its fine). During the whole duration of my stay, people's butts kept pushing up on me or against mine when they walked past. It was super uncomfortable, especially feeling pushed in the middle of my meal.
My boyfriend and I tried 3 different types of oysters, the clam chowder, and the north end cioppino with lobster (13 extra). Everything was super delicious. They have one of the freshest oysters i've had. I regret not getting more :( 
The clam chowder was also pretty good, but probably not the best clam chowder i've had. It is very watery but it was still packed with flavor and ingredients.
The north end cioppino was delicious. It is a little spicy but not really. The seafood on it complimented the ""sauce/soup"" along with the rice.

I wanted to get clam chowder and some kind of lobster. The clam chowder here didn't look as good as some other restaurants, but the lobster roll looked really good so we decided to give it a try. I made a reservation because I read that it gets crowded very fast and there's not much seating. 

We arrive and it's already crowded and very noisy. We were squished in a long booth with a whole bunch of other couples around us.  I sat on the side with the booth, and husband sat in a chair across from me. I didn't really have much room to put my jacket as there was people on both sides of me practically on top of me. 

I ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered a beer. I was disappointed that there was no specialty drinks on the menu. We split a bowl of the Clam Chowder. The description said that it was not as thick and creamy as the traditional New England Clam Chowder. It was thinner and more watery but it still had fresh flavor and the clams tasted good. 

We both ordered the lobster roll sandwich. There was the option to get it either hot or cold. My husband ordered his cold and I got mine hot. I thought mine tasted very good at first, but they put so much butter on it the roll started getting soggy and falling apart. I also stared to feel somewhat sick afterwards from all the butter. My husband's cold lobster roll was a little better, but he really wasn't amazed either. 

We were expecting our meals to be better, especially for the price that they cost. It was better than a lobster roll we could get in Pennsylvania most likely, but for New England I was expecting it to be amazing. I actually got a better lobster roll at a restaurant in Baltimore, and they're known for crabs not lobster.

The décor is brasserie style with dark wood and white tile walls and lots of mirrors. 
              Service.....adequate. I sat at the bar and the servers/bartenders were nice enough but not overly informative with the menu. Crudo of the day.......they didn't offer, I had to ask.  ""Do you have any questions about the menu?"".....didn't hear that question, had to bring them up myself. Their work space behind the bar is incredibly cramped and confining so I'm cutting them slack. I would definitely NOT work in that space myself so I give them credit.
              Food....ordered the buttermilk johnnycake with smoked trout tartare and California sturgeon caviar because I had seen it on a CookingChannel episode of Unique Eats. Very tastey. Loved the smoked trout tartare. The proportions were off though. Way to much pancake to fish ratio. The dish would be much more balanced with either less johnnycake or more trout tartare. The entrée was the North End Ciopinno with lobster (lobster is an optional choice but come on.......if you're going to do it, do it right!) Visually appealing and delicious. It could have been just a bit more spicier for my taste but that's a minor caveat.  It comes with saffron rice but I opted not to have the rice since I'm not a fan of saffron and why fill up on all that starchy rice when you have all that amazing seafood and delicious broth?

An old high school friend and I decided to try to beat the Friday night dinner rush and showed up at the restaurant at 5 PM. As soon as I walked in, I realized why the place is known for its wait - the restaurant is tiny! There were probably a maximum of 30-40 seats in the whole place, and this was with minimal open floor space. Regardless, I had heard too much about the lobster roll to walk away and the waitress was kind enough to take down our cell number so we didn't need to wait in the restaurant. 

About 10-15 minutes later, a surprisingly short wait, we got a call and headed back to be seated at the bar. First we started with a single oyster each - my friend got one from MA and I got one from NB (described as med size, med salt, with a champagne finish). Neither of us are really oyster connoisseurs so I can't say if the oysters were very different from the fresh ones I had just eaten at the Haymarket outside but unless my tastes become much more sophisticated, I probably won't be paying $2.70 for an oyster again. 

I had a small debate over whether I should try the cioppino but ultimately followed through with my original plan to order the hot butter lobster roll with a side of salad rather than fries. The very first bite was DELICIOUS, meaty, buttery, warm, and good. 

However, I have to question the $25 price. I haven't had many lobster rolls so I'm not sure how this one compares but I hardly think that substituting mayo with butter and heating the roll a bit should constitute a doubling in price. Adding butter generally makes everything taste good - so I wonder how difficult this actually is to make with the right ingredients. Also, the butter seeped into the bread and made the bottom half a bit soggy. Perhaps toasting the bread would help with this problem. Finally, the salad that came with it had a pretty presentation of lettuce leaves arranged as a flower but the vinaigrette was overwhelmingly salty.

All that aside, I still really enjoyed my experience at Neptune Oyster and was very sad to come to the end of my lobster roll. For those of you who love fresh seafood cooked well and aren't afraid to pay a premium for it, I have no doubt that Neptune Oyster can provide.",dp7hYl5O3_o3b4Bta8_25g,63 Salem St,"Arabian, Thai, American (Traditional), Live/Raw Food, Bars, Soup, Nightlife, Seafood, Restaurants",Boston,42.363237100000006,-71.055975,Neptune Oyster,02113,5115,4.5,MA,1

My boyfriend and I arrived around 11:30, thinking we were being smart to bypass the lunch rush but  man were we wrong. Long line, seats full and the restaurant is quite small, fitting 20-25 people. With how crowded it was, we ended up putting our names down for a 1-1.5 hour wait. We've been wanting to come here for a long time, so we waited the full time, and stalled at the Boston Public Market for some coffee just across the street. But if you want to eat here by 12pm, especially on the weekend, definitely come around 11AM to get ahead in line. 

The food here is no doubt incredibly fresh and cooked well. You can even see someone shucking the oysters right in front of the restaurant window. We ordered four different kinds of oysters, fried clams, the scallops and the cioppino. The fried clams came out first were really juicy, breaded really well, and overall tasty. The oysters were SO GOOD. Refreshing and flavorful, those oysters set the standard of how all oysters should dream to be. My absolute favorite part of the meal was the scallops. The combination of the tender scallops, smokey bacon, corn, pea tendrils, and sauce were amazing. It was a wonderfully balanced dish with flavors that worked harmoniously together. My boyfriend had the cioppino which was pretty much the sea itself with lobster, shrimp, salmon, mussels, clams, white fish, and rice in a spicy broth. I wish I could've tried, but since I'm allergic to shrimp, I had to taste it vicariously by how he described it.

I decided to cap off a week of good eating with lunch at Neptune Oyster. While tiny, Neptune is a cute space; subway tiles, a large mirrored menu, small tables, and a long wood bar. It reminds me of a Pottery Barn spread; you know the one where you wish you had enough money to replicate it, even the details and accents they're not hawking. It's not ideal for a groups of more than 4, I think there are only 6-8 tables in all. Also, I'm not sure I'd call this a great date place or at least a romantic one, at lunchtime it got quite loud. 

I don't mind dining solo, but this time I regretted it...a little. On the one hand, this place isn't much bigger than a postage stamp and flying solo I was lucky to immediately score a seat at the bar. On the other hand, there were so many menu items I wanted to try but only so much room in my stomach. After perusing the menu and drooling over the plates of those sitting next to me, I decided on the cold lobster roll. 

I had only tried a lobster roll once before, it was served at my conference and had an 80/20 bread-to-lobster ratio - meh. Neptune's lobster roll puts that one to shame. The roll was light and airy, and seemingly dusted with melted butter. The lobster was teeming from the bun; huge hunks of fresh, delicious lobster; writing about it is making me salivate. Hand cut fries accompanied the roll, those were excellent too; perfectly salty and greasy, a nice accompaniment to the roll. I washed it all down with a Whale's Tale Pale Ale, my only misstep; it was recommended by my server, but I wasn't really a fan. 

Service started out a little slow, sandwiched in between two parties at the bar it took a while to get noticed. Once I was, everyone was so attentive and friendly.

Just go early (line up 20-30 minutes before opening) on a weekend or at an off-peak time to avoid the usual 2-hour wait.,zJEKvMIK2T1Yyj-pz4h9iw,63 Salem St,"Arabian, Thai, American (Traditional), Live/Raw Food, Bars, Soup, Nightlife, Seafood, Restaurants",Boston,42.363237100000006,-71.055975,Neptune Oyster,02113,5115,4.5,MA,1

Supposedly this is the joint to get THE lobster roll. I've had several friends rave about it and I had to come here on my first night in Boston.

I met up with a friend and we were seated not too long after I got there. Just a heads up, parking in the North End is a complete NIGHTMARE! Try not to drive around like a mad person like I did, just find the first parking garage and walk. Everything is close by.

We started off with a couple oysters: Wellfleet, Island Creek, Wianno, Kumamoto, and another that I can't remember the name. All were extremely fresh and juicy. No grit or brine in the ones we ordered. I regret not ordering more.

We each ordered a lobster roll for our meal, one hot (with butter) and one cold (with mayo) to share. It didn't take too long for our food to come out and when it did my eyes completely bugged out and my jaw fell to the floor! Huge mounds of lobster right before my eyes. They don't skimp out at all! We had a discussion on which was better: hot or cold and I'm still debating on which one I liked better. With the hot you get the nice lobster slathered in butter. With the cold you get not just standard mayo, they have some seasoning in there that I can't put my finger on. I think just by ease of eating, the cold one wins by a hair. The roll was a little soggy because of the butter so it was a little harder to eat. You can also order it without the roll but what's the fun in that?! The roll also came with french fries, they were good but a little on the salty side.

The $25 price tag on just the lobster roll may scare people but it was soooo worth it! From now on every trip to Boston will require a mandatory trip here. Damn I want one right now!

This place packs them in pretty well and there seems to always be a wait.  Today it was about 45 minutes but it's nice because they call you back whenever something opens up.  I started with three types of oysters.  Forgot their names but they were all fresh and tasted like the ocean, definitely a good way to start off.  Last time I was here, I remember most people ordering the lobster roll so I already knew what I wanted and really didn't need the menu.  This lobster roll blew the previous ones I've had outta the water and I've had a lot.  Maybe because it was warm and all the others I've had were cold and had mayo.  This one is as good as it gets for me.  Nice warm lobster meat with butter on a nice warm soft roll.  So simple yet soooooo good.  It's 25 bucks but totally worth it in my opinion.

I usually arrive at the north end too hungry to wait the quoted three hour wait and find a different (and yummy) place to eat at. Last time, I got called an hour and a half later, but I was already enjoying a meal else where. 

I was prepared this time, had a snack before hand, arrived and had my boyfriend put our names down, parked the car, walked over, waited for cannolis at Mikes, grabbed a drink at a coffee shop, and finally got called for our table. This took about an hour and a half.

I was disappointed in the lobster roll. We ordered it hot, but felt like we got a room temperature lobster roll. I wanted warm, oozing butter dripping down my face! I have had better from Luke's lobster and a the Easton's Beach Snack Bar in RI for half the price.

However, I did fall in love with the Cioppino - such a large variety of fish, shrimp, clams, and mussels cooked to perfection with a hint of herbs and a kick of heat on top of saffron rice. Delicious. I will be back for that!! And maybe a few oysters from the raw bar. Great experience over all - had to try the lobster roll once, right? Enjoy!

My mom and I arrived at Neputne Oyster on a rainy Friday afternoon around 1:30pm and the place was packed! The restaurant is extremely small that you have to share tables with strangers. The wait staff doesn't even bother separating the tables out a little bit b/c there just isn't any space. And to make the lack of square footage even worse, camera crews were pacing back and forth filming a TV series for the Food Network (which was kind cool if the food was actually up to par). 

Okay....so I'll eliminate the service aspect of Neptune Oyster from this review since it wasn't an ordinary restaurant day b/c Food Network was filming. So..onto the main topic..THE FOOD! 

Between my mom and I we ordered Kumanoto oysters, Littenecks, shrimp cocktail, the hot lobster roll and the Vitello Tonnato sandwich. The Kumanotos were about $2.90 each and they tasted really fresh, however, I had got really sick after we left the restaurant.  I've had my share of raw foods at various restaurants and different parts of the world, and this is the first time I've had this happen to me. So you've all been warned...

I've never seen shrimp cocktail the size of my palm, but unfortunately, in this case bigger isn't better. The cocktail shrimps were overcooked which made the texture of the shrimp way too firm. FAIL! 

And as for the hot lobster roll, I was not impressed whatsoever. For $25 I expected a lot more. I agree with the other reviews that the roll was overflowing with lobster, but the bun was not toasted and our lobster roll was definitely not ""hot"", at best our roll was lukewarm. I was thoroughly disappointed when I took my first bite. If I'm going to eat a lobster roll dipped in butter I would expect to taste the butter. Our roll lacked everything I expected it to encompass. FAIL! 

I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try something that didn't necessarily sound appetizing. I ordered the Vitello Tonnato sandwich which was served with tuna tartare, roasted veal with a cumber salad inside. I thought I would try to let my palate experience different things, but this sandwich made a statement to my taste buds to never mix fish and veal in sandwich. The textures did not merry well and it was just a weird combination. I think the sandwich would have been better off just the tuna tartare and the cucumber salad. Also, the sandwich had way too much roasted veal and it masked the freshness of the tuna tartare. Again...FAIL! 

I'm sure after reading this review, you know what I'm going to say. Don't waste your time with Neputne Oyster because it's overrated and there's a pretty high chance you might get sick.

Love the well constructed space with the beautiful bar seating. Space is at a premium and I liked how they tucked the bottles of wine wherever they could. You will be right on top of your neighbors so be prepared for buts in your faces when people get up, and eavesdropping over the interesting conversations next to you. I don't order a lot of wine by the bottle just because I'm mostly a cheapskate and want to spend more of my money on food :-). Still, if I'm back at Neptune I will order a nice bottle of white wine because it really goes well with the experience. We started with briny, fresh raw oysters. The menu gives you good guidance as far as size and salinity. I enjoyed the cocktail sauce more than the mignonette but that's just personal preference and how I've always eaten them. Next was the star of the show:  the johnnycake. Oh yes, probably my favorite thing I ate while in Boston. The corncake had a perfect texture of softness, crispness, stickiness- just wonderful. The smoked trout and sturgeon caviar added saltiness and there was sweetness in the buttery sauce. Delectable. Mains were strong as well. The hot lobster roll was just about ideal - good size, buttery. Bread was fine. I think it barely missed perfection possibly just needing a  whisp of added salt or a splash of lemon. Still very good. Then, against all better judgement at a seafood joint- we ordered a Neptuneburger which will live in infamy as one of my favorite burgers. It's a hot mess with cheese and some fried oysters and I know not what else, but GLORIOUS smoky flavor to the meat, and it was juicy, fatty and fantastic. My son and I traded meals as we each liked the other's selection better so I got to polish off half the burger. Outstanding.

My sister, her husband and I came to Boston for the weekend. We decided to treat ourselves to a special seafood meal and I recommended Neptune based on your reputation.  My friends all told me to line up early, which we did around 11AM. We put our names down and were told we would get a call 1 to 1.5 hours later. Over 2 hours later we had not been called. We went to the restaurant to enquire and no host was at the door to help so we waited a little longer and were called soon after. 

We were sat down next to a couple. The waitress took our order for oysters and drinks. We asked questions about a wine (but it was clear she didn't know much so we didn't insist). We all ordered our drinks and ordered 12 oysters. The couple next to us did the same thing. They got their oysters shortly afterwards. 

Our waitress then took our order for our meal, we ordered the following :
For apps:
One Johnny cake
One clam chowder

For our entrees
One lobster roll (cold)
One cioppino
One Bottarga Vongole

When my sister enquired about the Bottarga Vongole, she asked the waitress if the dish was linguini based. The waitress looked unsure and said she would check. We googled and it showed up as a clam linguini dish so we ordered it. 

Our drinks arrived but not our oysters. The couple next to us finished their oysters and then got their Johnny cake. After they finished that, they got their lobster rolls. All in a sequence. 

What happened to us was a disaster. Our entrees arrived first. They removed the covers from the hot dishes. We were surprised as we hadn't even been served our oysters or apps yet! When my sister saw her Bottarga Vongole, she was surprised, there was no pasta... just some Israeli style couscous. We asked the waitress. Her reaction was to correct her and say that ""that is pasta, it's called pearl pasta"". No apology. No offer to swap it. No smile. Nothing. She only ate the clams and didn't touch anything else. She was charged $35 for the dish. 

3 minutes after our entrees were served, our oysters arrived. 2 minutes after that, our clam chowder and Johnny cake arrived. We couldn't believe what was happening. The couple next to us got everything in sequence with a gap between their dishes and we had to make the choice to eat everything at once to avoid things getting cold. The experience was so unpleasant. We were all quiet, no one was talking. I was embarrassed. This was the meal we'd been waiting for all year and it was awful. We couldn't enjoy it.

And this is just half the story! I left the restaurant feeling fine and around 1.5/2 hours later started feeling unwell. We had to rush home after I started getting severe stomach cramps. I was sick all afternoon and all night basically spending all my time in the bathroom and in my bed. My sister and her husband had to go out alone on Saturday night and I had to cancel our plans that night. 

This whole experience was an utter disappointment given the reputation of your restaurant and the $250 bill we paid in full.

Ordered 1/2 a dozen oysters and the cioppino.  The oysters were of course so fresh and no broken shells, so I was off to a good start. The cioppino...OMG...makes me want to move to Boston. It was packed with seafood and every single morsel was cooked to perfection: mussels, clams, fish, prawns...you name it. The prawns were so sweet and succulent it almost made me hate living in the Midwest. All of it was paired with a flavorful, spicy broth and toasted bread.

I could never get in here during normal hours, so we went for lunch at 11:30am, and got the lost spot at the bar, in front of the door, on a freezing cold rainy day (and thus people constantly stood with the door open trying to get the attention of the waiter, subjecting us to a cold blast air, as we tried to tell them it was already over an hour wait, which the waiter would finally tell them 5 minutes later.)   

The hype and the crowds is over the top. The food is not quite, but still good.   If this was a quite little place near the water on the North Shore, it would be greatest discovery ever.  As a really busy place in the North End, it is pretty good -- but doubt I will ever repeat.  The prices are very high, even by North End standards.  The food again is good but not over the top, the wait staff is attentive but overtaxed dealing with the naive crowds are of people who think they're going to get seated any time soon.  

Boston should have best seafood in the country.  It doesn't, or at least it is hard to find.

My friend and I got on the list for the last table for the evening at 8 pm.  We had a 2 hour wait to be seated, which was expected.  It was crazy to see people being turned away for the evening, but I figured it was a good sign.  They take your cell number and call you when your table is ready, which is awesomely convenient.  To me, the wait is not an issue if the food meets expectations.

So, our table was ready and we started to dine.  I ordered the toasted lobster roll, hot and buttered.  My friend ordered the curried mussels and the clam chowder.  Maybe it was the fact that we were the last to arrive for the evening, but my lobster roll was very underwhelming.  There were some tender, delicous pieces of lobster, likely from the claws, but a good deal of the meat was chewy and lackluster.  The roll was soggy and untoasted and the butter did nothing to help.  For $26, I would expect more.  I noticed other patrons with soggy rolls left on their plates as well.

Now, my friend's dishes, the chowder and mussels, were much tastier.  I absolutely loved the mussels, and our server brought bread to dip in the curried sauce.  Very tasty!  Her chowder was just okay to me, it seemed like a ""broth"" that was mostly cream and not much else.

But there is one most notable character missing from my review and that is...the oysters.  I ordered two Thacher Island oysters based on their description of being plump with a buttery finish.  Talk about amazing!  Those were the best I'd had and very memorable.  They were perfect with a squeeze of lemon.

For the price, the wait and the overall meal, I'd say this place ended up being average.  I'd consider going again, early, but for just the mussels and oysters.

When we departed with full bellies and empty wallets, patrons arriving were told their wait would be upwards of three to three and a half hours!  One bowl of soup, two sandwiches, and a bottle of wine later, our bill including tip was $170! Steep prices and super long wait aside, I'd go back! This is a casual place, dress how you want. This is my first Yelp review, felt compelled to warn of the ridiculous wait to eat here! Here's the kicker... We are thinking of going back before we leave! They take your name and phone number and call you when they have a spot for you.

Firstly, no matter what, you will probably wait a minimum of 45 minutes to be seated. I think my party of 3 waited a little over an hour - which we used to walk around the neighborhood, glimpse  Paul Revere's house, etc. Once seated, you are subject to hearing every loud conversation around you because of the small space, and a constant line of people at the door, which never seems to close. A woman at a neighboring table was yelling almost constantly at the patrons waiting to ""close the door"" as the draft of the 50 degree day was quite chilly coming in. 

We only ordered oysters and drinks and although the oysters were delicious, we had no idea what we were eating. All three of us had ordered 9 or more oysters of many different varieties, but the restaurant refused to put them on separate platters, and they are not labeled. They simply told us to start at the lemon slice and work your way around the platter with the oysters in order of top to bottom on the menu. There were multiple circles as we ordered about 18 oysters and with the varying sizes, it was impossible to tell which circle was which. Prices were a little pricey but mostly comparable.

After reading all the reviews, my husband and I decided on a plan of action to get a seat without waiting for hours - go on our run early on a sunday morning and arrive at Neptune within a half hour of their opening at 11:30am.  Mission accomplished as we arrived at 12:00 PM to a full restaurant with people and fish everywhere!!  They took our name and number and said 30-45 min, we will call you.

We walked around and finally 40 min later they called so we practically ran back. Once back we still waited a few minutes, no biggie.  Placed at the bar with a raw bar menu we were ready!  The descriptions offered on that menu were extremely accurate.  We love oysters and were looking forward to some east coast varieties.  So happy to have killer descriptions to keep us in the flavor profiles we prefer while being able to expand to some alternate flavors.

Post oysters, I had the shrimp cocktail and I have NEVER had shrimp like that!  The server was very knowledgeable and when she suggested four shrimp as my ""meal"" I decided that I could always order more later.  My husband ordered the hot lobster roll with ""light"" butter.

My shrimp: HUGE - almost the size of a 1.5lb lobster tail.  No joke.  I wasn't sure I could eat all 4!

His Roll: ALSO HUGE - based on the 1.5lb lobster I had today, there had to have been 4lbs worth of whole lobsters meat on that roll that was so soaked with the light butter that he couldn't even eat it but man, was it so fresh and tasty!!

 I did have one failed attempt at dinner here and learned my lesson - if you are going specifically for the lobster rolls, as most people typically do, theres two things you should do:
1. ASK if they are sold out of lobster. on our first attempt to eat here, we went in at 7 pm, with an hour wait, by the time we were called for our table only to be told that they were out of lobster. we were going SPECIFICALLY for a lobster roll, so this was like OMG DEVESTATING news. I left heartbroken, but live and learn.... if you are waiting for a table and give your phone number, they can call you if they run out in the meantime to give you a heads up in case you would like to make other plans.
2. go as EARLY AS POSSIBLE. don't show up at 8 pm and expect them to still have lobster. this place gets BUSY and things do get sold out, despite what the hostess may tell you - when we made our second attempt at dinner here, we were told ""that never happens!"" well guess what, it happened to us! we knew better to play it safe next time and go directly from work for an early dinner.
do this and you will have no problem.",-79JpP-2xtztpWQv5mNYXQ,63 Salem St,"Arabian, Thai, American (Traditional), Live/Raw Food, Bars, Soup, Nightlife, Seafood, Restaurants",Boston,42.363237100000006,-71.055975,Neptune Oyster,02113,5115,4.5,MA,1

We knew there would be a long wait, but we were pleasantly surprised when asked for our phone number and told the hostess would call us to come back for our table. Mind you, it was a 2 1/2 hr wait, but we've waited over an hour outside of other places we love, so getting a chance to enjoy the city in the meantime was great. Come on a nice night, put your name in, and go grab a drink and an appetizer somewhere else to hold you over. Don't come to put your name in too late or you might get turned away--there was a group who came at 9:30 when we got back and they were told no more names were being taken because the wait was too long and they close at 12.

We got back just over two hours later to check on our wait time, and the hostess actually had spots open at the bar and we were able to sit right away. She and our waiter were both very nice, I noticed some other reviewers thought that the staff had a 'tude but we didn't have that experience. 

Got started with raw oysters, which neither of us had ever tried, and with the help of the bartender decided on a couple East coast, a couple West coast, and some littleneck clams. The East coasters were super salty but good (I believe they were the Kumamoto),  but we both actually liked the West coast ones more. I forget which ones they were but in their description I remember they said ""with a melon flavor"" or something like that. Still salty but not as briny as the East and the sweetness was a perfect complement. Clams were little but good as well. 

Finally, we both got the hot lobster rolls. Amazing. Buttery, toasted bun just bursting with huge chunks of delicious lobster. Most places will run you $18-25 dollars for a lobster roll, and they're $25 here, but absolutely worth it and definitely have more lobster than any other place I've been. Also worth mentioning, despite their business, we didn't feel rushed at all by our waiter and were able to take our time, which we appreciated.

A: Ain't gotta ask me twice.

I've never been here, and it was high time I gave it a go. I'm kind of a picky eater when it comes to creature treats, but I will try anything from the ocean at least once. With such a tiny place and a no reservations policy, I knew coming at peak time on a weekend night was going to be a bit of a challenge. This was not an incorrect assumption. We considered scrapping the whole idea but some time spent at Goody G's took the edge off. We ended up waiting an hour and a half, which was exactly what we were told. 

We were finally seated by a little half cherub, half merbaby statue perched behind our seats who eyed our every movement with his languid, frozen gaze. The table arrangements here are not for those that long for privacy, you will no doubt get dragged into conversation by those around you. Just (lobster) roll with it. After our adult beverages were procured, we launched into our appetizer and raw bar orders. I got the Japanese octopus salad and the rest of the table got a nice sampling of oysters. I enjoyed my salad, though it didn't quite have the wow factor I thought it would. The little bit of citrus flavor that I did get was divine, just need to pump up the volume. Being the incredibly individualistic persons that we are, everyone got the hot lobster roll for our main course. 

Okay.

Can I say, when you're about 2 prosecco glasses deep on a humid summer night a hot roll of rich meat is maybe not the best idea? Despite the awkwardness of eating such a thing in such conditions, it was really pretty good. Very buttery, if I go back and order again I may ask to go easy on it next time. The bread was good, and the portion was massive. And the fries. Oof. I can't even explain how good they were. We did not have to wait long for anything, service was swift but a little barebones. Kind of expected a bit more out of the place in that department.

We got here around 7pm and since it was a spur of the moment thing, we had no reservations. 
As expected, the place was packed so it was not too surprising that when we put our name down for a table for 2- we got a
response of  ""it's going be a 40min wait"". OK- no problemo.  - gave the digits for a call back when the table was ready. 

Hungry took over so we headed over to a side street pizza joint for a snack. The name escapes me right now but it was good... I guess that's just gonna be a different yelp review.  :)

We did our business at the pizza joint and 45 min later. Still NO call.  I know- I'm a bit impatient and very much an ""are we there yet"" gal.  We decide to head over to Neptune to see what the hold up was. 

When we got there, the hostess advised that we could look at the menu to see what we wanted to order.  Gladly obliging we looked on as our mouths were salivating.  We waited another 15min to be seated.  Is it 8pm already? 

We got seated at a table and since the place is really tiny, the tables are placed right next to each other.  They pack you in like sardines, elbows to elbows- no personal space.  We were lucky to spot 3 empty stools at the bar instead and were able to move.  Still elbows to elbows, but the thought of the cute guy sitting diagonally right across from me while I wolf down oysters was not going to be pleasant.  I recommend sitting at the bar instead. 

We got 1 1/2 doz of oysters and 1/2 doz. of cherrystones,  hamachi tartare and the roasted wild sea bass.. all to share. 

The oysters and cherrystones were very fresh, but I have to say, they were small.  I've had bigger.  The hamachi tartare had nice presentation, but was unfortunately overly tart with citrus flavor.  The people next to us saw what we were picking at and also ordered it.  Too bad they didn't ask us how it was. They took a few bites and had the barista take it away and ordered a salad instead. No joke. 
The bass entree was very tasty,  except for the pancetta that the fish was sitting ontop of- it was way too hard.

You're literally squeezing between north and south oriented bars tools and seats just to get to the tables, bathrooms and exit. No reservations are taken and my guess is you'll be playing musical chairs like one plays musical pizzas at DiFara in Brooklyn.  

On to the food.  Each oyster is intense and distinct in flavor.  The kitchen food is a different story, it's not horrible but IMO it's too expensive for what it is.  Creative but certainly way too mellow (ie bland).  Oysters seem to go for an average of a $1.50 a pop no matter where they're from.  Pretty damn good for what you get.  Follow those with a Whale Tail Pale Ale and you're doing well.

So, between the very briny oysters and equally briny beer, the ambiance and antique decor, the lack of bad attitude from the servers, all this more than makes up for the space and kitchen food hassle.  In fact all of this combined has a nice calming effect.  Something very rare in a city where it's nowhere near the population of the Big Apple and yet you have less elbow room and certainly crazier drivers.

We called at 10 to place an order for 8 lobster rolls for the band, some of the crew and for us and had the hostess tell us it was too bad, they weren't taking any outgoing orders. So we spent $20 for someone to take a taxi over there to place the order and when he got there, she wouldn't let him order either! So we I to call to explain what the deal was, and she was the most unprofessional person I have ever dealt with at a restaurant.

Try the warm lobster roll. It's expensive, $30, but it's good. You should try it at least once.

We believe in doing our research, and planned our restaurant selection accordingly - we were here on a weekday right at 11:15am (15 min before opening), and we were the second party in a line that grew pretty quickly after us.  It is a bit non-descript before they open, we weren't the only ones to do the walk-by, double-take, walk-back while we were searching for it.  Tip:  look for the name on the awning, since the storefront glass is all covered up by what looks like bullet-proof armour which stays up until they open the doors at 11:30am.

Anyway, the food was just delicious - we started with a selection of oysters and clams from the raw bar, and can totally understand why several other diners looked like that's all they had - they were the freshest we've had anywhere to date.  Next, three of us had to try the Lobster Rolls, of course (hot with butter) - they were wonderful.  I can understand why some people aren't overwhelmed by them - they really are just lobster meat drenched in butter stuffed into top-cut hot dog buns, but boy, when you put that much perfectly-steamed lobster, slather it in butter till it takes on both the flavour and colour of the lobster, and then let it soak into the barely dense-enough to hold together bun, it is heaven!

Another reviewer complained about the fries only being meh, so I wasn't expecting anything great that way, but man, those were perfectly fried and salted (I know there're about as many opinions on what makes a perfect fry as there are people who eat them, but I challenge anyone to say they weren't good).

As for the service, I found it on par with our other Boston experiences.  In one phrase:  no-nonsense.  Pleasant enough, but you can tell they care more about keeping the line moving than making you feel welcome (warm and fuzzy is not on the menu).

I sensed that a trip to the area would not be complete without finding a decent batch of raw oysters to consume.  While partaking in bantering with business associates in Seaport, I decided that a little intel gathering here would go a long way toward success.  Neptune... Neptune... Neptune.  That's all I got.  Was there no other choice?  While heading back into my hotel in the North End, a quick conversation with the doorman confirmed everything... Neptune.

I got there as early as I could which meant about 6:00 and for a party of one, a twenty minute wait was nothing (though by the time I left, a party of four would have to wait two hours!).  The place is quite small, but well worth any wait.  I left my cell phone number and ventured around and magically enough, the rang me up when things were ready to go.

It can be as daunting as ordering wine or sushi when presented with a list of oysters with different merroir.  I went with simplistic descriptions such as buttery, briny, and champagne which landed me with Moon shoal, Tatamagouche, and Beausoleil respectively.  Fantastic.  Fresh and clean.

For a main, we had the lobster roll. After all, what is a trip to the Northeast without lobster? And Neptune makes a good lobster roll. They certainly did not skimp on the lobster with meaty chunks of lobster stuffed in a soft and buttery brioche bread. Tastes amazing warm, although I imagine it's a very different, equally mouthwatering experience cold.

Neptune oyster certainly held up to the hype.  We tried three different kinds of Oysters and I the local oysters were amazing and packed with flavor.  We also split the clam chowder.  It was good, but not your traditional chowder - it is much thinner.  It is probably the only thing I would skip the next time, but that is in part to make more room for the delicious food. 

We had to have the lobster roll. You had a choice of hot or cold and we went with the cold.  The lobster roll comes out and the lobster is just falling off of the roll - it is that packed with lobster.  The roll was nicely toasted with a little bit of butter.  It was meaty enough to support the lobster, but still light so it didn't feel heavy or dominate the lobster.  The lobster came with fries that were freshly cut and nicely salted.  

Neptune also has a very nice wine list.  We had a pinot grigio that paired great with the seafood.  Our waiter was very helpful in picking the perfect bottle for our tastes.  They certainly know their wine and seafood.  The only complaint about the service is that it was sometimes slow.  I can only guess it is slow because they are always busy and can only pack so many people behind the bar.

And dessert? I have no idea because  I didn't get that far.  Instead, I choose to have another round of oysters for dessert.  This is very important for someone who loves sweets and chocolate.

The selection of oysters is diverse, the lobster roll is a classic and overflowing with lobster, the Johnny cake is a nice sweet and savory option, the clam chowder is not dense and thick like other places. While not the cheapest place to dine, the pricing is reasonable for the quality of food served. 

The ambience is quite nice with the dimmed lights yet casual friendly atmosphere of the servers. It is quite small so you can feel a bit cramped inside, especially if you sit near the front door and there is a crowd of people standing nearby waiting to get seated. 

On our last visit, we got to sit at the bar right by the front window where we got to watch the designated oyster shucker work non-stop. We chose a variety of oyster (including my favorite kumamoto), the mussels which were perfect, and of course the lobster roll. 

The one thing I always struggle with this place is the wait.  The first time I went a few years ago was on a Saturday mid-afternoon where we waited about an hour and a half for a table for 2. This most recent visit was on a Tuesday evening and we ended waiting about two hours for a table for 2. (There's a great dive bar across the street where you can hang until you get a call letting you know your table is ready.) While the food is great, I think that a place like Island Creek Oyster is very comparable (lots of oyster selection, great lobster roll, nice ambience, much more spacious) and they take reservations, a big plus.

I guess that the plus side of having all these snowstorms is not that much people going out. Anyways, the menu is simple and straight forward enough with good descriptions on each item. 

Food: Northend Cioppino - Spicy stew with saffron rice and seafood. The grilled salmon on top of stew was done perfectly. It had the right level of pinkness and firmness that always surprises me since it takes careful timing to pull it off. Well, the slices of salmon were thin so I guess that helped. Included in the contents were mussels, clams and shrimp still in their shells. The spicy soup (too watery to be called stew really) really hit the spot on a cold night. Overall, a good dish but could give more based on the price imho.

To start my meal, I decided to go with the clam chowder. The clam chowder was good--but definitely not one of the best I've had. There were quite a bit of clams in it and they weren't too chewy, but I thought that it lacked flavor overall.

For my meal, I decided to go with the monkfish. The monkfish was slightly overcooked, but the meat was still flaky and went well, especially when paired with the lentils. The lentils may have been some of the best I've ever had--a great pairing with the beef tongue.

Overall, this place served up some quality dishes, but I can't say I was overly impressed, with exception to the lentils.

Since I was solo, I looked around for the hostess, hoping to get that empty seat. After 15 minutes, with no clue as to who the hostess was, I asked the bartender if it would be ok to take the seat. 

""No, the hostess will seat you""

One of the people waiting told me that a woman who was bussing the tables was the hostess. 

After 10 more minutes of her studiously avoiding eye contact, I went to her, to let her know I was a single diner, and gestured towards the empty seat, and I asked if it was ok if I sat there. 

""No, I will put you on the list. should be about a half hour. I will call you. "" I was then dispatched to the outside of the restaurant. Because it was only going to be a half hour, I waited outside the door on the sidewalk. 

The seat remained empty for 50 minutes. Would have been plenty of time for me to order and eat. 

By 8:45, I watched as multiple parties who had been signed to the list after me were seated. At 9, she finally said she would have a seat for me. 

Then she made me wait again, inside, 
as I watched three more groups being seated. Two of those groups were 2 tops who arrived at the restaurant and got on her list over hour after I did. 

There had been several groups of three, and she was ok with empty seats, but apparently leaving an empty seat with a single was a problem for her. Some of the twos seated before me were at the bar. 

I was finally seated at 9:30. 

Since I have worked in restaurants, I am a big over tipper. The bias against single female diners is unfortunate. I travel frequently for work, and am sadly, accustomed to the occasional shitty service as a single diner. This experience is the new benchmark for shitty service. Her behavior made me want to leave zero tip. 

Yes, the food is great. The guy who waited on me at the bar was nice, knowledgeable about the oysters. I was even ok with being served French fries instead of the salad I ordered, which arrived when I was pretty much done eating the lobster roll, because he was a good dude. 

The hostess went above and beyond to be an asshole though, and that was unnecessary. 

That the restaurant is successful it's in spite of the hostess. 

If Neptune had the last oysters on the planet, I would not go there solely because of her. 

I hope that one day, the tables are turned, that she's a solo female diner in a strange town and that the hostess treats her the way she treated me, and apparently numerous other diners.",x0VZRk_4vVAXwtG103Ul7g,63 Salem St,"Arabian, Thai, American (Traditional), Live/Raw Food, Bars, Soup, Nightlife, Seafood, Restaurants",Boston,42.363237100000006,-71.055975,Neptune Oyster,02113,5115,4.5,MA,3

I do think good things are worth waiting for and in the case of Neptune it definitely paid off!  We arrived a little after 7:00 pm.  Here is how it works - you stand outside in a short line to talk to the lady that sticks her head out the door every now and then.  She asks you how many are in your party and then takes your phone number.  They will call you when it is about 15-10 minutes before you are going to get seated.  I love this method personally because you are required to just stand in one spot for a long period of time!  During this process we got to know the people in front of and behind us in line.

Finally slightly after 10pm we were called.  When we arrived it was interesting to see the people who lasted and the ones that did not.  We were all super excited to indulge in a dining experience we have been anticipating for some time. We were seated by our friends from line and some people that were at the end of their meal.  All the seating in the restaurant is super close and tight, so you can talk to the table next to you easily.

We ordered a round of rose wine for the two of us and then the big order.  If you come here you must try the Lobster roll - it is a must for sure!  We got it warm and it was so buttery and delicious.

We were in Boston for the night whenever I consulted Yelp for a place to eat.  Neptune Oyster had the most reviews in the city along with a great score and so we headed on over.  Upon arriving I have to say that it wasn't what I expected as it was a little restaurant that was crammed to the gills with people.  There was a bar on one side and some seating on the other and that was it.  At most I bet it could hold around 40 people.  We asked the hostess if they had room for 2 and we were told there would be a 20 minute wait.  So we agreed to that and went elsewhere to wait since there was literally no place inside to wait.  Right around 20 minutes later we got a call and headed back and were seated at the bar.

For dinner on this evening I decided to go with a mix of things from the raw bar as well as regular menu.  So to start out with I went with 4 oysters in order to try the differences between them.  The ones that I chose were a Katama Bay (MA), Beach Point (MA), Savage Blonde (PEI) and Beausoleil (NB).  Some of them had exotic tasting notes with things like popcorn, brown butter of champagne finishes.  I would be fooling myself if I said I tasted anything similar to that.  Yes they tasted different but not in a way I can describe.  Since I am newish to tasting different oysters that shouldn't be surprising.  In any case, they all were briny and I thought they tasted quite good.  After those were finished my appetizer came out which was a bowl of clam chowder.  It was large and quite good as the broth was creamy and there were a number of clams inside of it.  Once that was finished my entree came out.  I had ordered the Acadian Redfish & Chips which the menu describes as fish and chips which came with malt vinegar aoili, pickles and MV sea salt.  Honestly, this was probably the best fish and chips that I have ever had.  I am sure that was helped along by having a good fish inside and that malt vinegar aoili to dip it in.  Heck that stuff was really good and I would love to have a jar of it to take home.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While Neptune Oyster isn't for the claustrophobic, their food was really good and I am glad we went.",4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,63 Salem St,"Arabian, Thai, American (Traditional), Live/Raw Food, Bars, Soup, Nightlife, Seafood, Restaurants",Boston,42.363237100000006,-71.055975,Neptune Oyster,02113,5115,4.5,MA,1

My friend and I ordered the triton platter and thought would order the lobster roll after if we were still hungry cos we ate a bit before going there.

The seafood from the triton platter was fresh, had a mixed of oysters, claims, mussel, shrimp, lobster and blue crab salad. Must say that the crab was AMAZING!

We were full after the seafood platter so didn't order the lobster roll. Came back the next day for lobster roll...nothing special. ..I totally feel like I make better lobster roll. Also ordered the uni toast and it was way too salty and too much butter.

Ordered a few oysters, personal favorites was the Neptune pearl, island creek Duxbury and for west coast: the Kumamoto.. I highly Recommend the kumatomo! Big and creamy.. delicious! 

We had a total of 3 lobster rolls during this trip and by far this was the best one!!! I ordered it cold with mayo (Boyfriend ordered hot with butter) it was soooooo full of lobster, very meaty and worth the 32$ (market price) the hot was good too (I personally like hot lobster rolls) but it does fall apart cuz of the hot butter.

Ordinarily we'd have just eaten at the other restaurant but we really wanted seafood soooooo...

We eventually got to eat here...

We got some oysters and shrimp to start with.  The shrimp were good but not exceptional, a little chewy... which for the price I'd expect them to be sweeter and not so tough.  The oysters were super fresh and the mookies in particular were amazing.

The cocktail and mignonette were both freshly made.

We then ordered fried clams and the plate was HUGE and piled high with freshly fried clams.  They were salty, crispy, and delicious.

We also tried the chowder, but it was too thin- it was almost watery.  The flavor was there but it was unappetizing because it was kind of like clam flavored milk.

My friend also got the lobster roll which was wicked expensive and did have a good bit of lobster in it, but was nothing exceptional.  In fact the bread was a little soggy- the butter missed the lobster a little...

My friend and I came at around 12:30pm, and the expected wait time was around 1.5-2 hours on a weekday! I have heard from others that it is best to wait in line before the restaurant opens in the morning to ensure a spot. 

Even though the estimated wait time was very long, we ended up getting a call from the hostess around 45 minutes after putting our name down. Also, the time goes by very quickly, since there's the Boston public market around the corner and a lot of bakeries, in case you want to try Boston's cannoli to hold you over in line. The restaurant is also very small, with only a few tables and only some bar seating. That day, we were seated at the bar, which we were more than happy to take, given the long wait at the restaurant. 

Between the two of us, we shared a warmed lobster roll with butter and a half a dozen of oysters. The lobster roll was around $30, but it's plenty for two people. It comes with either fries or a salad, but I would definitely recommend the fries if you're not ordering anything else that's too heavy. The fries were thick cut, crispy, and seasoned with just the right amount of salt. The lobster rolls come in either the cold-mayo form or the hot butter form. We opted for the hot butter recipe and it was delicious! It was piled high with thick pieces of tender lobster, and not over dressed with butter. The oysters were also as good as hyped to be--super fresh, sweet and buttery!

From the raw bar, we ordered several oysters, clams, and fresh uni. The seafood was the freshest I'd ever tasted. The Maine uni that I had was so good that it tasted like it wasn't from Maine - unfortunately, my boyfriend's was a bit unpleasant due to a strong ammonia flavor, but they quickly replaced it with another one.

We lucked out, walked in & got a place at the bar. I noticed, however that just minutes after our party of 3  were seated, a group of 6 diners came in and THEY had a table reserved! So what gives, Neptune?

But I digress from the most important part/s: the food! the oysters! The service!

Service: Glad I got one of the gentlemen (Mako) behind the counter. His female counterpart seemed just too exasperated to repeat the menu offering (NOT described on the printed menu other than Triton Plateau or Neptune Plateau). Yes, I was happy to leave him a substantial tip too!

Favorites:
Lobster cocktail : your are served the meat of an entire lobster, at the very least, dressed lightly with olive oi, spare seasoning and pinch of some parsley - absolutely satisfying, tender and briny, fresh. No Mayonnaise or cocktail sauce at all - PERFECT!
Crudo of tilefish : served in a ring, chopped pieces of white fleshed fish, reminiscent of Hawaiian Poke but without any added seaweed or chilies - fresh, clean, buttery, RAW!
Lobster roll, in butter, served on very yummy bread and french fries on the side. 

Oysters! Oysters! Oysters!
there were so many varieties offered, mostly from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, some from Washington state and even Vancouver BC. 
Had a sample from a dozen different varieties: best for me  Island Creek and Basket Island.
Had them raw, sprinkled with a little bit of lemon and horseradish (served on the side). Also available is a vinegar/diced shallot dip (Mignonette) . 

Splurge: got a bottle of Prosecco to go with it!

Shout out to the lady behind the counter who actually shucks ALL the oyster orders: She did such an excellent job, not a single bad oyster, or piece of shell in any that I ate.

Lobster roll here is impressive. The buttered roll is literally STUFFED with lobster meat. The toasted bun is so good. I like that the bun does not get soggy and stick to your lobster meat. 
Also tried their mussels and cioppino. Mussels are amazing and is a great starter. Cioppino unfortunately was not the greatest, but not bad! I've just had better ones elsewhere.

The restaurant itself is really small. There are about 8 tables, cramped together, and a bar area. I am seriously not a fan of seafood but my opinions may have changed because of the awesomeness of the food here. The lobster roll (warm), oysters, and fried clams were exceptional. Nothing gave me the impression that I was eating something straight out of seawater (a main reason i dont enjoy the taste of most seafood lol). My only complaint would be the salad we had.

Maybe they would claim link to pagan superpowers with Neptune himself? Okay that's taking the metaphor too far, but in any case, Neptune Oyster lives up to the hype. 

We each started off with a clam chowder, and it's not what I expected--it was better. I'm used to creamy, chunky clam chowder that's heavy on potatoes, and Neptune's version was lighter and with a consistency halfway to that of a soup. It's a surprise after mentally preparing yourself for something indulgent, but you can actually appreciate the subtle flavors of the clams instead of a Campbell's cream of potato. They were also very generous on the portion of fresh whole clams. 

Similarly, the hot butter lobster roll was no less than epic, even though it was again different from the mayo-based lobster salad rolls I had pictured. Neptune's embraces lobsta rolls in its purest form: an overwhelming serving of pure lobster, minimally dressed with a thin layer of butter, sandwiched in a fluffy brioche bun with just enough carbiness to complement the lobster which stole the show. The fries completed the feast.

Tip: The food was delicious and the portions were big. I split with a friend where we each got a clam chowder and shared the lobster roll, and it was the perfect amount of food (with just enough space for a cannoli afterwards). The other seafood looked amazing as well, and I don't think you could go wrong with anything.

Tip #2: The space is fall and this place is infamously popular, so I suggest getting here early (i.e. by 5pm on weekdays, and even then expect a wait).

So I actually found out about this place through a recommendation of one of my boyfriend's friends. Seeing how this place has been recommended highly on Yelp and articles/blogs, I couldn't leave Boston without checking this place out. 

Now I was prepare for the wait. I've read everywhere that you should expect to wait a couple of hrs to be seated since the place isn't that big, and there's tons of people that line up to eat here. We came mid-December and I expected the weather to be much colder, so I actually brought some body heat packs with me to keep me warm while waiting out in the cold. My boyfriend and I arrived at Neptune Oyster around 6PM, to our surprise, there was no line! We got seated once we came in! Keep in mind that we got seated at the bar area (they told us if we wanted a table seat, we would have to wait approx. 10 minutes which is not bad, but we didn't mind the bar seating and took that option instead.) It was also pouring down rain that day so I'm assuming the weather played a role for why the place wasn't packed.

Okay so onto the food, we ordered the Lobster Roll. Market price at the time was $31. Definitely the most I've ever paid for a lobster roll, but you're getting a good amount of fries with that as well (even though it doesn't seem like it in the photo, it's a lot!) Normally for that amount of fries in NYC, it would cost possibly $6-7 as a side add-on. So I'd like to think I paid $24-25 for the lobster roll, which I feel is pretty avg for lobster roll in Boston. Whatever excuse I can think of to justify spending $31 on a lobster roll LOL. This lobster roll was amazinggggggg. An overflowing amount of lobster meat on the hot roll, so juicy and delicious..

We also ordered oysters: Wellfleet, Island Creek, Mookie Blue & Kumamoto (2 of each). My boyfriend and I could definitely agree that we preferred the Wellfleet out of them all. Super plump and juicy (plus the biggest one out of the ones we ordered)! It was actually my first time having oysters, so I wasn't sure what to expect! But Neptune Oyster has definitely set the bar high for me.

We also walked to Mike's for some cannoli before getting in line around 11:00AM. There were 3 parties ahead of us which wasn't too bad. Like most restaurants in Boston, seats are limited but since we got there early we got seated and the wait was 30mins. People who came later had to wait 45mins to an hr.

So there I was, trudging back to the T with my duffel, another evening free to dabble in the dark arts of stuffing my face. Where to go on my (second) last night in the city?

Duh. 

Everyone had told me I needed to try a lobster roll, and everyone had told me where to find the best one in Boston. So I grabbed a stool at the bar of Neptune and ordered one (cold, with mayo). In the meantime, at Damien S (my hostest with the mostest)'s behest, I tried a Kumamoto oyster, and it was a zesty summer tonic. So was the sauvignon the bartender suggested.

When my roll arrived, it was bulging with lobster meat and flanked by a frisson of fries. Seriously, I couldn't decide which part of my plate to turn my attention to. I had been warned that lobster rolls could be bread-heavy, but this one was overflowing with tasty morsels. So I inelegantly dove in. So. freaking. good. (and for $25, it better be).

I also get that there is a point where the restaurant cannot take any more names for the night.

What I don't get is the complete lack of organization and basic customer service by the staff. I walked in waited 5 minutes, couldn't identify who was taking names. I went to the server behind the counter and asked who we put our name in with? I get a shrug and she then states she doesn't know where she is and she is not sure they are taking anymore names-busy night, got it. After waiting another 10 plus minutes, not seeing anyone other than servers, I ask one of them (had to politely ask excuse me several times before I could get them to look up) where I was  weren't taking any more names...

I get a popular restaurant on a busy Friday night is full... I do not get why a place can't simply have a sign indicating they aren't taking anymore names tonight and not putting their staff and customers in a spot where one cant deliver customer service and the other can't get basic information.

Maybe small places that are in such high demand don't feel like they need to have basic customer service as people will just flock there anyway based on reviews on Yelp? I ended up with an excellent experience down the street at Union Oyster where they had a simple system in place for names and a staff that seemed genuinely interested in providing good service.

We did a late lunch here, and we didn't want to spoil our appetites for the NYE dinner we had later that night, so me and my girlfriend just got the Lobster Roll.

Neptune Oyster is the greatest restaurant that I have eaten at.  Reagan could have given the Russians a lobster roll from this place and the Cold War would have been over in one delectable bite!

We arrived about 25 minutes prior to it opening and luckily were about 4 people away from NOT making the first wave.  We sat at the bar (I recommend you do the same) and enjoyed the hell out of our meal.  The lobster roll was delicious, but who knew that the bread used for that roll would be so amazing?  The fries were impressive too.  We also had the Triton Plateau; an amazing collection of crab and lobster salad, muscles, clams and oysters.  All of the items were fresh and fantastically flavorful.

N.O. has an extensive wine list and draught beer to boot.  Yes, this place is expensive, but seafood typically is and it's certainly worth setting aside some vacation money to treat yourself to the best seafood in Boston (and possibly the world!)

**Tip 1**  Try to get to N.O. 30 minutes before it opens.  Yes, you can always wait for 2 hours for dinner, but stuffing your gullet at lunch allows you the rest of the day to walk around Boston, to burn off some of that buttered lobster

x Clam Chowder - great clam chowder. Little to no heavy cream so it was lighter than what I'm used to. Generous amounts of clam :)
x Hot Lobster Roll - WOW, such good lobster on this roll. I think I may like the lobster at Jame Hook better, but this was SOOO good because it was bathed it butter. I didn't get to try the bread part because I was so full, but the lobster portion was very, very good. Get the hot one, not cold!

Absolutely ridiculous and incompetent service. A wrinkled up piece of paper was obviously not a sophisticated enough system for the hostess to keep track of the waitlist and actually contact the appropriate numbers. 

Upon review, the phone number was correct, she just never bothered to actually contact us as promised. We met several people outside complaining about similar experiences. I'd rather be at Pearl Oyster bar in New York than this knockoff. At least when I wait an hour there, I know I'll actually be seated and enjoy an amazing clam chowder and lobster roll. 

After being told we would be seated next, we waited outside again for another twenty minutes and realized this hostess was obviously not going to seat us unless we waited inside where there was no way for her to avoid us. Amazingly, we were then called.

We were finally seated in the middle of an empty six person table and served water... only to be asked to MOVE a few minutes later. At this point the service was laughable and we had put up with such incompetence we figured the food must be their saving grace. We were wrong. 

We were served a bowl of milk as the clam chowder, shots of overpowering salty brine as oysters, and a basic mediocre lobster roll with butter. The arugula salad was the best thing they served.
